# mathQA-cse599

This repository contains code for translating math word problems to annotated formula using attention-based seq2seq model. The model was trained on the MathQA dataset. Much of the code is based on code from Stanford Course CS224N (2018-19). 

MathQA [dataset](https://math-qa.github.io/math-QA/) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13319.pdf) 

This project was completed as part of the final project for University of Washington CSE 599 Deep Learning taught by Professor Ali Farhadi.
