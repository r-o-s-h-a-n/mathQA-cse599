You know what I do is write for kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read the <unk>
And I always say to the people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany usually is something that fell anywhere.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle began in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I was going to bleed up every week in the bathroom bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the <unk> room.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years I was feeling the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at half the night I got a phone call from that master Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never come to know us.
You could <unk> to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I would like you to do it please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and we took it, and we took it away from his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was
We knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult arrived at <unk> it became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about it was made in its own itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and love, and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can quickly, it was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> myself around the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't think that it was about a <unk> on another <unk> over year after year.
<unk> are born when we fall out of glaciers or break down the barriers of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold up to the end of the while others can't afford it, and they become a <unk> of passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated apart and alone, as well as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As an melts as a <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere.
As an iceberg it releases water freshwater in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I come back to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, and knowing that in the unique moments exist in that way and will never exist again.
It's not the death when you're <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is one iceberg that I photographed on <unk> Greenland.
It's just often to get to see an iceberg in it.
Here we go.
You can see the left on the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an annual size rate.
<unk> of the water about 120 or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so he <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want it to be too much in the details of conception, because if they stop and think about the understanding of it, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it gets life.
I'll come back to talk about them later.
In my activity there will be two <unk>
In one of my roles with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people are looking at anatomy -- that is, of human bodies, and <unk> how have they considered the body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about in the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients, or as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working with fraternal twins -- two people within a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit into male and conventional female groups.
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> lots of shapes.
I'm going to put some examples in ways to have an sex that doesn't fit in the male forms of the male or female forms.
For example, the case is the case of the <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene, which is <unk> of the chromosome -- that we all have in the life of life that becomes <unk>
And then in the life -- the testicles are producing testosterone.
But because this individual lacks <unk> of testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So, there is high levels of testosterone but without feedback.
And as a result, the body develops following a course typically female.
When I <unk> the baby has a little bit of a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, about puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period when someone realizes something is happening.
And then they set up tests they realize that instead of <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk> and <unk>
And the important thing to understand is that you can think of a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women like men, we have in the body called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know his structure -- I think being a typical woman most of women like me are sensitive to <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, somebody like me has the brain most exposed to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> has <unk> <unk>
That's why sex is complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> he had her <unk> and sex with her, he was wearing a life as a boy and I just found out that I was publishing and womb.
He had an extreme way of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus, <unk> glands were so active that, essentially they created a male hormone environment.
As a result, the genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it went to 19 years when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th <unk> develop what is known as <unk> is that they have <unk> tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know what that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies that are <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> are <unk> by <unk> surgeries to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that we put together several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that particular anatomy brings together, a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity, <unk> is a black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture with <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children that are born like two people in a body.
The most high one is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the trial in the <unk> of <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What test are you going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is not such a test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, more we have to admit that these remarkable categories were going to define that these previous categories were <unk> directly with <unk> categories that are directly <unk> are much more <unk> than they were doing.
And not only in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something which is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a very rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we put it into science we get more and more in a <unk> zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, is the struggles in principle and at the end of life.
It's hard to set a moment out of which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone considered died.
Our ancestors never had to do with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of them put a pen in front of the nose and if it moved still not to <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body, and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma to determine really death, and this is placed in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gets me nervous.
I think these categories are much more fragile than we thought about.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did -- that I find each other watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why it happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain to me why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and it was <unk> with another which was radically and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power came into the right of political power for the right blood of the hands of the father and then to son, etc.
<unk> <unk> had rejected that idea and replaced it by a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game of play and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not <unk>
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> the democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there is very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> of the economic explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed down by a vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> coincidence.
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened years later?
And women's women.
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the middle of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
Again, people of color who are going to be <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking questions why we maintain certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some divisions in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> before anatomy.
I don't want to say that kids in five years were supposed to have sex or married.
There are <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why do they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, he was born in term, was born March March 1980.
In the fact that I was born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to Henry -- sex -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because I have a different biological age, but it was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, what I have to be considered as a man -- though I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a <unk> <unk> that Mary does not have to worry.
Mary, on his part, doesn't have the same rights of marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So we still do <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science advanced both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a <unk> democracy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we will do."
But many people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided to marry one man you don't have to have chromosome on and to marry a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't test people <unk>
But this is also very strange to the story that I told you to the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his "I "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people who are <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very <unk>
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do we judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to do this for human rights to people, because I would admit that I know of some <unk> <unk> that they probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make smart decisions and <unk> about their sex relationships that I know.
So how do you put the theme of <unk> content.
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me wonder what would happen if the character of a person could in the future will be measured with an MRI <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to <unk> unless they are willing to submit to an ear of sex, in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon who I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made to give <unk> twins and then pick it up his <unk>
But when the phone asked him was a very <unk> operation, he told me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
So what I said, "Well, he's considered the political asylum rather than <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who are <unk> to change the end of the state.
So I think we need to be in the head.
Well, to finish the end of that, I mean, I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given to greater participation at <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in doing the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about studies of studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I was considered <unk> as a <unk> made me <unk>
<unk> what about feminine <unk>
And I thought, "Is the stupidest question I've heard.
Feminism has to get rid of unpicking <unk> <unk> so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more it has similar to me that there is something female in <unk>
I mean, there might be something different on average, something different between the female and the male and the male that makes us more <unk> to social social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very attentive to find the way to protect people in the state, it is possible that if we have gotten more <unk> to this concept, we would have enriched the concept of protection with cognitive support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we explore democracy beyond the individual's think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more in relationships.
So as we tried to create a most perfect, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinking where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility of choosing at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than their construction cost.
So we could easily push it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just went through buildings in the apartments.
Imagine that half of the people who wanted to live in apartments already were owners and the other half still dared to do it.
They could try to increase the <unk> capacity in all the existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place, and build an entirely new apartment building a completely new apartment building and when the rules of that place would build the construction instead of getting <unk>
And so I proposed that governments will have new reform zones that have big enough to contain cities, and I gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to ensure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following presidential elections, <unk> <unk> had a platform on which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to <unk> her chief <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of evidence to users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say you can't go and annoy to all the current residents of apartments.
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but we need so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and they're usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a Guatemala was a graduate friend -- I sent to <unk> a link to the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So December we met in Miami, we met a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion -- and at some point, when there was a pause, when there was a pause, and he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain is a charter that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not to live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called the <unk> and he said that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which involved an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport, covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that would be at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The Library of Congress approached the platform and said, <unk> <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could get to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from the North.
And we also need new choices for leaders.
Because the U.S. government leaders would need help from <unk> countries -- they could benefit from the countries associated with them to establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that they could all rely on the <unk> so that they could all rely on <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This photo is there.
It could be nearly a thousand square miles.
And so soon after that, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special development regions.
In a country I had just gone through this crisis, the voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional constitutional was <unk> to one.
Everybody and all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To make it in the constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, there was another time on another voting on the other time of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the printer on the 21st of February, a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> went to the two places in the world who are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is built in Korea from <unk> is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years after the <unk>
The other country in building is in the building of cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the managers to evolve and then would allow to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow their Supreme Court to be the court of the last reason for this new justice system.
There are urban builders <unk> of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are many companies who wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change it immediately.
There's one million a year out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go get a <unk> work, sometimes they're mothers who have to earn money for so much eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What seems to be thinking about insisting that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession -- public and that's I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photographing and post and post on my blog and colorful different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to know people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what we would take for this exciting TED week.
I mean, what do you bring with somebody who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I was.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
<unk> inside exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I want to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman walks for TED in <unk>   that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be bad humor, when you're wearing a bright red suit.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not just <unk> you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you carry in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember her next <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you're good at something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you don't look at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'll explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, there's no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We have to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people were approaching this week just by what I was using. And we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, he said, "I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave back certain things.
I don't need <unk> emotionally to these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another suit and colorful and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where's your brain at this scale?
Some of them went through one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like -- with a great exhibition in both of them in the same time.
It's not that they're mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them playing with them, and then we see as <unk> and then we see our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you may have developed with the age of years is that he says one thing can be just in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar of parking room taught him a valuable lesson -- and that is that the big things don't allow them to be <unk> and that remain in a place.
This is a great conceptual model of the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of weird things -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years -- you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But we didn't need to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That's not really good at my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But they don't really get to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it hasn't been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a nice, quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to expand it a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a very large approach to small metal <unk>
So what we see is a little bit of metal, with a springboard and which goes up on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with an silicon chip with a new silicon chip and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole <unk> <unk> that's found under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator itself, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up, I leave you to do those things, because I don't want to do it, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
And the voyage of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that we have to do, and the wind that goes on to its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We take the lights, then you pick up a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then you get it to a temperature of less than one degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way I was planning was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when we give him a soft, we were able to make it happen, and that doesn't go at the same time -- something that only happens to quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just at certain <unk> when those were <unk>
In the rest of the time you're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was a clean room in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between only one atom and that little piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my part that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act on your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we turned it, and we turned out the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, you literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head who's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months old.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they would take it with 17 very interesting museums.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go in museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to really make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better that shows the demo to then explain a couple of interesting things that we've done since its launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums that there are.
There's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to get into one of my favorite ones, in the <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You're moving around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall, right?
Come forward. That was <unk>
<unk>
But I haven't got the best.
Now I'm in front of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image -- for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get about 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really do with 10,000 million pixel up.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I walked into and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
I was talking to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is a game called <unk> which is a <unk> with a pole on the <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get further into depth and you'll see that it really can be even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the image, so you'll really see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump back at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite ones, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, all of you, don't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives it the same.
You can online creating its own museum, create its own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I have created this function that I call "The <unk> <unk> we just went around to zoom in.
This is <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when I look at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't come from Google.
No, in my view, they even even come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium makes justice in the digital <unk> and it's represented properly online.
And the big question that makes me today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of this is a <unk> a pixel rate.
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from Italian, all the kids in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that there's something very interesting at <unk> <unk> one in the last two decades.
Now, some time ago, if you wanted to win a race of <unk> one, take a budget and you would take it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot and the pilot were good enough -- you made the race.
This is what in engineering, we have control over real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronic electronics.
They're going back to the open air.
And as <unk> are starting to answer differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a voice -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet but represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
<unk> 75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the atoms in the existing atoms become sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end, he took the hammer and he went down to the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I actually won the Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity wrong on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
At late early there are people around here, and there are <unk> <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> of France.
<unk> people do a fast call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, <unk>
That night they all went to <unk> the center.
You see the big summit.
The next day they all went to the center of the team of the winner and the prime minister of then.
And then the whole world left.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from <unk> <unk> people will <unk> it's a big party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but things we use and consume.
Today, we know all about the origin of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a <unk> how do you look like?
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle recently over a year ago, to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening very complicated things and there are lots of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> is not going to be on somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we put one day is still there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That's the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and a lot of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at first, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city, which came to us and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and you get <unk> vacuum tubes, you get open and <unk>
It creates like a <unk> of water with pixels of water.
If the pixels are going to be writing in them, to show patterns, images, texts.
And the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And <unk> a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no windows or windows, but when you come up with it opens up so that you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days always will be somebody, in the winter, when the roof go down the roof, somebody who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it is working.
It looks at people who are <unk> so it goes in.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> the testing the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way of interacting had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that turned to you to leave him happen, but a building that followed by <unk> and holes, and one I had to jump to not get wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as we architects, engineers, designers, we always think about using people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things for interacting things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water, and of <unk> about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like you saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, form.
A kind of flexible screen, like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or <unk> but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the pixel up.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appear on different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D, which you can get closer and forth and see from very diverse <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like it before.
When the light turns on, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, and so on, etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> today, the star of the New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as a entry for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's both 3D <unk> in real time as motion capture.
It can take all the movement.
You can go through all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm -- but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world to the digital world.
We have digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign, we can move the digital world of the digital world of self-organizing power to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow may be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in our collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud they are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered from the pixel up.
You can move inside, you have different experiences.
It can be seen from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and can be used as a way of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose you would tell them that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could improve it by more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, to be harder to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure about ourselves?
What about living with good health?
Or maybe they're those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is they <unk>
What would you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are we <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see you.
<unk> I probably owe the number of creative people today.
That's pretty good.
How many would you choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most people. It makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or maybe it is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you a glimpse of a doctor on the subject.
The great 18th-century <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> which also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense of the light of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution -- consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
refers to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well in one end, is clear, most of us care.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far away from other parts of the life of life, but actually, in its most mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is chemically <unk> that comes out of <unk>
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> raises the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, mobile.
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to want no effort to effort.
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional neurological disruption of some hasten to <unk>
But therefore, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single <unk> and human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope that you've <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- in most existence of life, in the <unk> organisms each cell simply splitting and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when organisms appear <unk> things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one might say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student, I was thinking, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but every year I was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits his door in a hotel.
He opens the door.
And in front of him he finds a wonderful light dancer.
He looks at it and says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "It's fine. I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal, the goal of <unk> not necessarily different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to get healthy.
I wanted to restore health in disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about going through the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view of evolutionary view and I are like rockets that are designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us go to the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't <unk>
Evolution is not necessarily favors longevity.
Not necessarily favors the biggest or the strongest or the fastest or even smart.
Evolution favors the best <unk> creatures to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there would have fish there, fish integrated into empty fish -- yet they've managed to do that an <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we look at the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that through medicine, in first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that would have been <unk> and written from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> so that we are no longer that we have the necessary isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of the traditional kind of traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would ask that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when as a species <unk> distant planets are going to exist the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in nature.
But there's a third possibility, an attractive possibility and intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you pick up on the individual and family level.
Think about that if you were possible to be able to choose not just the sex of their <unk> but in your own body making the genetic sympathy, to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
By the next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost to 20,000 to 20,000 and a week.
Not much to make the human genome really to make the human genome for <unk> and be increasingly in the reach of everyone.
They come from those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can do viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental essay on the course of the vaccine against the flu disease in a plant plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then just two little <unk>
They can change the cells of your body, but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change sperm and <unk> or change the newly <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, to remove <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same analytical technology that the same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to be allowed to be able to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of <unk> machine.
Why don't we have a slow muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why wouldn't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in terms of communicating this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we wanted to have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could lead to 100,000 years and we can give them to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren are going to have them.
We're going to use these options in <unk> of a better and more successful society.
Or, we're going to selectively chose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for anybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or worse, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine by doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single car seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to flight flight.
So he immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. I would probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Often that's not the <unk>
It <unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three most <unk> words that I have heard of.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to do in life, and I thought about all the fences that I wanted to get and didn't, all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open.
I don't want to spend anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while I was <unk> the bridge George Washington -- which wasn't for much -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also gave a place to my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that <unk> in things that I don't care with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I am saying, "Please be <unk>
I don't want this to break down in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
I got to connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
At the top of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, of not dying that day.
And the gift was given to me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back in another way.
You know, you're flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens to you on your plane -- and please not be like that -- but you can imagine, and how do you start?
What is it that you might expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy.
And most importantly, they're being the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the coolest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he arrived at his house after running and he said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis.
You can only use your eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation company, so obviously, graffiti is something <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
And so we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and he can be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, not that I saw Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and you have good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable to people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way -- they get <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can I be?"
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I sat down with her brother and his father right there at the very precise time, "OK, this is <unk> Tony is going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make your art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in your interior cannot be <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer that you draw on that and record negative space.
So you go around doing art as this one.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First, they start with sexual organs, then with bad words, then with the attacks at Bush and the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of an organization and a lot of moving things on one side to another we had a couple of things.
One is, we played the gates of insurance companies and we got a machine so that you could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "You don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers out of all the world's corners of all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took the control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and when they were <unk> they would have taken the pictures of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks <unk> we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of cheap sun glasses that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a camera <unk> we put it on a light light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds one -- we published the code, the software goes down in the way for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, <unk>
There is no hospital to say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That's awesome.
So, at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, Tony intense all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed for that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking wall outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling of the <unk>
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was played in seven years.
I felt like I'd been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and would pull me out of there so that I could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
In some form that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> screen.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We won many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The awards were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong got something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends of closing the <unk> is that April of this year in the <unk> in the Los Angeles center is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty amazing.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, you can do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology, I just recognized something and I was excited with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want we all to do every day when we find ourselves with something we feel that you need to do.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations in which are usually very difficult and at the same time as much as dangerous time.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
Film on areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days that I had just this fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been focused on situations in situations in horrible appearance, with the only goal of trying to look at social questions in ways that we would make attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that were <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was coming here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, volunteered to sell the rights on the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk -- which you have no idea what it is about and as a content I could do in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or their company to do it.
But that said this is a very good <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would have no idea for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the business of <unk>
And as I said before, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing I could do with it, nothing could be so difficult or as dangerous as I walked into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about <unk> product and marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with product products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The biggest <unk> ever <unk> is that everything up at the top at the bottom, at the end, it has a brand picture, all the time; from the <unk> that comes before the title was the mark.
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is what? <unk> Is what? <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure that we will take all of the categories that we can on the film.
Maybe you get a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe of <unk>
The most great car that you've driven in "The biggest <unk> ever <unk> the best you ate -- <unk> of "The greatest <unk> ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then also to show the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> making it <unk> the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film was complete transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the complete idea, all the shot of principle to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how responsive is going to be the people.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're going to be very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> No <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half a <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be a difficult meeting with them, but it certainly will be worth convincing a couple of big brands <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we look at a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So, I want to move. I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where they go.
MS: And I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, I was to give you the product as many people as possible, making as many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the separate media -- is not the idea to tell that new vehicle that's worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were missing.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: The free simulation of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the <unk> even the CEOs <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency day --  like that weird bear that still still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk> path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and saying we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want them to be <unk>
We want to give you a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was lying to me in some lie -- and that's he staring at me as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
Is it your story, it's my story, and there's the real story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, and I would have to take out of the proxy and go to corporations myself with all my team.
So what I started to figure out all of a sudden -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, enormous, giant films and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant films of <unk>
And the film is called "The biggest <unk> ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "You're cool to this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you that <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have as much as a man like for <unk> solid, <unk> <unk> like it.
That's the overall picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a little bit.
We get to the kind of smaller movies that we have, we're rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget of other brands.
So do things like that, you know, you know, remind people is why this interest is.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> That's a big question.
<unk> Technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something cool <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep you fresh time? With better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man of the street, the people like me, the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothes.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something only <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, many gray colors, and things like that.
Usually I wear accessories.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: Part of you in part of it -- partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet guy.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out there because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be labeled Tom but often <unk> me at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they could do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
A: <unk> a little bit of how your thoughts and feelings are going to be.
MS: These people shape my way to look at the world.
A: <unk> of that world.
MS: That world I think is that your world is the world in which you <unk> like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All those things come back and start in a place and in my case come in and start in my family, in West Virginia.
AT: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
AT: How do this relate to your thoughts and feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like <unk> I like weird things.
A: <unk> for what is that for that?
What's the <unk> What phase is <unk> What phase is you find is now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
So let's get a little bit about that.
A bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You know, there's no fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
AT: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Big <unk>  Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of them -- but <unk> on your personality, <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They worked very well.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I believe that some companies just fall into one of their strong points or the other rather than focus on both.
Many companies tend to do -- and it's nature <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> to prevent fear, those elements, and you actually give you to <unk> and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the <unk> Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> and conscious marks those things that have gone and come up but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to take your <unk> your brand, your brand mother, what would be?
You're a <unk> You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk> attribute of it.
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> are like being playful being cool as <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold or bold as <unk> <unk> fast or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical <unk>
Or are you rather <unk>
You're aware, sophisticated as <unk>
You're traditional -- you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable stable, familiar, reliable safe, sacred, or wiser, like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the end product.
It allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we now use MRI resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing like film.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned air in the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are becoming a path in schools with available problems in America.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I have had the greatest response or in which I've gotten more successful are those in which I've been doing with things directly.
And that's what they did these brands.
They went back to their agencies, and they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no better interest in mind.
I'm going to try to directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think of people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he left? <unk>
Well, since the movie was sent out in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we have had 900 million media impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or press, TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this movie has begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong for almost all the agencies that we talked about with their clients not being <unk>
I've always believed that if you take risks if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you pull the people out of that is pushing us into failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss of risk is preparing all their company to be involved.
I feel that what has to happen to progress is we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give rise to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at once, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
Today more than never a little bit of honesty is going to go along a long way.
And that said that, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who had bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So that's the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket -- I have a check for the name of the TED matrix of TED, the <unk> Foundation a check for me for TED on next year.
The idea behind the worm worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
<unk> gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- are a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus on Windows on a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray box, so we are ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
<unk> in the gray box, hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to investigate <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> <unk> I used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
So that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they had very strange things.
They were <unk> as a lab rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense to me.
And then from experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that place: at the time.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that struck my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant in the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
They better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out the attack code, and we found that I was <unk> in two <unk> bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
It was all the points that I would attack.
They probably even know how much it hits the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and in high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code code.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at first was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we were trying to engage with the real world with potential targets in the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be an valuable, white, and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
There are not several thousands of targets in that area.
Basically it boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the plant of <unk> <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants among our <unk>
And I called them up and I went back to an effort to get her experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that cell part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> it certainly can be <unk> and even make it <unk>
And what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and adapt it in an obvious effort to go back to nest maintenance engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and their structures.
So for example, number <unk> stands in that code, you can't get it.
I started to investigate scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it was <unk>
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had in their hands.
And so that wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been coming from several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet we found that both digital <unk> used to just one single and same goal, but from different <unk>
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry that other targets are going to be <unk>
Here I show you a few very interesting things that we saw -- really <unk> me.
There's the gray box and the top is the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input values of the sensors, for example, of the sensors, and the sensors of vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which still runs during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake entry data are <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the large steam turbine goes off speed, you have to open escape tubes.
Obviously, this can't make a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can get bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> no security system <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant, or in a <unk> plant.
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> to disseminate this payload with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional <unk> technology.
We can make the most possible.
And if you do that, you know, that is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We need to face the implications, and better that we start to do now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can take you and give <unk> skills or another one that will make users out of wheelchair and go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's not different than something you put in the morning, it gives you a large force that is also increasing its speed, and help you, for example, drive balance.
It's actually the true integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect it with the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working with, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a <unk> charge of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to be even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries on our back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage on my back.
So we decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the brain-controlled exoskeleton -- I can hold it 90 kilos of land for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run a big <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device -- this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of <unk> and what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people like this, in <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often with very young people, with damage in the column that when they started their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be your only choice.
We also talk about the population that is aging very quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, since their successful <unk> as I need to recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had a injury in the neocortical column and as a result of it couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It's got <unk>
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer on board here on the back.
There are some batteries that give the engines in the bionic <unk> and in the knees, and they make it move with this very smooth smooth, very nature.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when I was a stranger leap in the air, skiing it down on the bottom, he was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all sensation and all movement <unk>
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my bedroom in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last minute of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs the bottom at <unk> climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that would make me walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all of the chairs of <unk> to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the Man of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know his cousins.
This is the world of the <unk> Bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their living lives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society, the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where the deadly violence has not yet observed.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great <unk>
They live in the depths of the forest and has been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been taken for decades and caused almost so many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts the survival of Bonobo.
<unk> meat trade, and deforestation do you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos who are in the world -- and, honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the hidden laughter, the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes -- the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the lives of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
As humans, as humans, they love to play throughout their life.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us and the game is fundamental to make links and foster <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo, Bonobo sees the roots of the roots of laughter, the dance and the ritual curve.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "You have <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he love, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is both common in bonobos like humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female -- who is playing with <unk> water.
I think that like her, sometimes we played themselves, and explore the boundaries of our interior and outside worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples from the understanding that Bonobos to give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we need to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and higher cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> of adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes need to play.
But let's go back to the maximum task of game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and human in the way, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be the least appropriate thing to play, they can be the moments that I'm most <unk>
So I am primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together while they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers will engage a highly qualified staff -- one has to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But yet there was a career to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner of the owner of one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end night, she was standing outside the rain under a <unk> <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got to come before I was -- <unk> <unk> <unk>  He got first to the captain and he asked him to go inside the dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I entered a burning building to save a live place because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
And the captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to get home.
I need you to take the fire, I need the fire, and bring this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but I was looking at the stairs, at the end of the hall, and I went to the <unk> firefighters that at that height was going to be able to turn out the fire and went into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the ladder that I met my <unk> and the precious dog on the front door.
We got out of the house the treasures for house owner where, as he was to expect, his treasure. got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department got a letter from the house owner of the courageous house for brave courageous effort to save their house.
The kindness that she looked at on the rest was that somebody had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling on Robin <unk> like in my calling as volunteer volunteer I'm witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or they are for doing this remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: I don't hold on.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get it right now.
He took food in a dining hall, <unk> an amusement park.
be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's lives, but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first particular blocks of concrete was built in <unk> with a very simple idea of <unk> modules of a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges or a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, <unk> bricks came to all the home.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful buildings to build beautiful buildings.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block of concrete, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex, one brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference that the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't appreciate that the building blocks of our time are booked to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is coming together by magnets.
So you can't actually put it wrong.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> the pink is the <unk> the pink and the orange color is the wire.
So we just have to put together a blue thing with one green and very quickly, you can begin to make bigger circuits.
A blue with one green makes light.
We can put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change a button on a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk> gestures.
To make it faster or slow down, just like this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to <unk> bricks to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We have given to the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does one turn of night, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers, no experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> designers in the School of Rhode Island School who have no experience in engineering, just in <unk> and paper, and we said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a barrel of <unk> activated moving movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that is made of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in reach of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking for getting to the environment focused on focus on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can get better on the video to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, the time I was in time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
We took a few members every year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of getting them to the Third World we send them to the wild world <unk>
They did great <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
As a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I could find a date, but what it really looks for is that somebody else is being caught by the snow, because he knows that it's not very good at putting fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time, I was very much a last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members named Erik <unk> noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he got <unk>
If you don't, somebody can be <unk>
So it has a component uprising.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology <unk>
And it spread into viral form.
A responsible for the systems of Mexico City to see this application realized that he could use it not for snow, but for citizens to embrace <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people squeeze the batteries.
So he asks the citizens of <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just got <unk> to get people ready to clean up sidewalks when they were <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that plan using it.
And this has been spread out without <unk> in a natural and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to be able to choose the best public school for their children.
Then we were told that it was done by the normal channels I would have taken at least two years and seven billion dollars.
And that's nothing.
There is now a project in the court court of California that until time there has been 2,000 dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that you program in a couple of days and it spreads on viral is a kind of shot of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests to the best ways of working, not as in private companies as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
That is, no <unk> in the open, <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way of dealing with the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an African institution, but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good at collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to <unk> dollars every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up with the government.
They feel a great frustration to that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something we have lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line of politics, the <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that give us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in essence, in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they alone don't exist.
Now, many people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government yes.
And because the government ultimately made out of -- remember that <unk> the <unk> how to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the center of energy services for services and information.
It's the place that serves if you brand 311 in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
<unk> <unk> in official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put it very hard and see if it was <unk>
And it worked. So it's good.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an online and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
It doesn't <unk> that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New <unk> <unk>
One day, this really comes up with this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so you all see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I walked up the place, I found the garbage <unk> behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, <unk> <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the government income to collaboration, voluntary <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily talk about the definition of technological <unk>
I talk about a platform for people to become <unk> and help others.
So a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And it might have connected to the government services that we need to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative, cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call control animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think you're the entrance to the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a pharmaceutical leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will provide our values and connect our needs, but then we don't see it.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the superficial surface <unk>
So it's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot contempt.
But this is what keeps this thing that keeps us that we've funded as something that's operating in our costs, that something else, and a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the true government works.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of governance.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report on <unk> pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the project of financial reform.
That's not political activism -- is that it's <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> to the government, it's time that we asked what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we get to go with no solve the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't <unk> government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible for the technology to root the root function of government so that it can be <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act -- only we have to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of the members of our members is 28 years old, so I, to <unk> I'm a older generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who you're going to talk, they're all going to talk.
They can express your opinions on any channel and do it.
So when you face the problem of government don't care much to do your voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring hands to the work to program that will work better in government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a fire hydrant, by taking away them, dumping a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to clean those <unk> and many people do.
But these applications are like a digital <unk> that we're not only consumers -- we're not only consumers of government we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until you don't get <unk>
So I want to ask everybody, when it comes to the important things we have to do together, all of us together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent the most part of my life in the communities of <unk> in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing about these <unk> he has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
If something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here's fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they're taught with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> that was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was hard, I had power.
It was the last word in the whole conversation in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but she was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I was going back and forth again, and if he said yes, I gave me in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always wish to be near it.
The only problem is that he had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
If I was going to spend a time with her, it was not easy to capture his time and your attention.
My cousins was running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and there was all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
And I thought it was a game.
So he looked at her and he said, but she was really serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, walked through the room, and he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on. We put them up. We'll take them up.
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say <unk>
And I said, "Okay, I want to go.
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't do it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said to me, "Only I want you to <unk> three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want to do is you just want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I <unk>
Then he said, "I second I want you to tell me is that you're always going to do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
Then finally he said, "Well, the third thing I want to do is that I would never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural <unk> I have a older brother and a older sister a year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother got home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us my sister and me and we went for the forest.
We just had the <unk> of always, as well.
He took a sip of beer, offered my sister, she took a little offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You know, I'm not going to get <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I went up with the <unk> and I said, "Oh, not that you're still thinking about conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is getting <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never had a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that really don't make sense of.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died from age-related diseases.
And these were the things that we had to do with it, as it was <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate of <unk>
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, there is so much <unk> so determined by these facts.
One of the three black ones between the 18 and the 30 years is in jail or a <unk>
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Washington, by 50 to 60 percent of all the young color are in jail, or in parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is much better and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not problems of ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work a few things curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, you love you about rights to always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before you put the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
America is the only country in the world of 13 years sentence to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, no chance to come back.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people at death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
Very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we're in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crime crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
General death penalty is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent that it's <unk> and released from death row.
One of the error, an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never be allowed to fly airplanes if in every nine that <unk> one would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time I started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted up to the Second World War.
We really don't know much about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a defined time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his life.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you says of talks, <unk> <unk> to people who stop saying that in our history history, for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time I went through with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany talking about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good worrying to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> we have no death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we do, intentional and <unk> we were <unk>
So let's think about this.
How do we tell ourselves in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were in their vast majority of them.
We couldn't <unk>
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things are <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both of these things.
Now, we've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more <unk> with the basic challenges of life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in a way, something that is within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to intellectual people.
With innovation, with creativity. development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that are also about the heart of the heart.
This connection of your mind with the heart is what drives us to look at it not just as bright and <unk> but also the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I believe in communities as TED, must be <unk>
There is no <unk> disconnect with technology and design, which allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty to <unk> to <unk> to injustice.
Now I want to suggest that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were just gathered to talk.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> calls me to say to me, <unk> comes <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I know <unk>
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, I'm going to tell you this is that idea of justice <unk>
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to help.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with life sentences without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and when I finish up looking at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> out of very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> put me my finger on the face and said, "Is that why you have to be very but very <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way we face those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is superior to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that belongs to me, isn't that a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there is an basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's how it is.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very carefully, we don't judge our technology, because of our own intellectual and rational.
By the end of the end, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat rich and powerful <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, do them <unk>
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
I sometimes do too much force.
<unk> tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been convicted of a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> clients and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone in which is not it?
Justice <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night very late one evening was awake <unk> for God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer -- a tiny, poor, poor, black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> so that my <unk> black customer is treated as a privileged white <unk> of <unk> from a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there that there had been a behavioral conduct in the <unk> at the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a lack of moral.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or actually <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> it was sent to court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got to the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down the car. He went to court.
And I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> he was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "I'm <unk> I said yes.
So I was <unk> and I was <unk>
And I was interested in listening to it.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When he arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And we started walking.
People started to. They were all <unk>
I was the one who had written those crazy things.
The policemen the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. Everyone <unk> because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I went to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look like the window and try to hear all that <unk>
I kept walking here and there.
Finally, this old black man in the face of worry, walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood foot, he looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this audience room to tell this young man who keep his view on the goal of <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds up to justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and our dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who have all of us who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view on the target for <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your way, do something.
Something that is not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to take care of the funds that are spent now in <unk>
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> cases did not stop in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't come to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that this funds is going to come up with the law enforcement to make the security law.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been an enormous decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, is said that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you what you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The vast growth in massive <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic rise comes in the population of <unk>
And we got to convince ourselves for the rhetoric of it.
We have three legal causes to bring people to chain to supply them by stealing a <unk> by small crimes against property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does not do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've excited to be <unk> here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats.
<unk> 2: <unk> in Somalia.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media media prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every single day, our senses are getting so much more data than the brain can be <unk>
And like nothing more to survive, the first stop of all this data is an old snippet of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is our warning detector -- the <unk> detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us sick.
And so from a <unk> of stories, we would look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there's blood, you know, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, seven days a week, 24 hours per day, no wonder that we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it doesn't.
Maybe instead, what happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good issues of climate change, the <unk> of species, the lack of water and <unk> without doubts that we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and in the long run, we just ended up with them.
<unk> then what's happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> income per capita income through inflation, has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of transportation and transportation has fallen down to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful age of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy spent 25 percent of over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we continue to get more and higher expectations.
In fact, they <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, moving TV, air, air conditioning and cars.
<unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is the technology and then lately, its exponential growth.
And my good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that I was doing in technology technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer for the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, how smooth is it -- at good and bad times, in war and peace, in the recession and <unk>
It's the result of rapid computers that we used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it curve is going up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, it is to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, which my <unk> of <unk> call infinite computation and sensors and the ability to democratize 3D printing and its ability to democratize the visual print on the entire planet, the synthetic biology, the fuels and food and food, digital medicine, the <unk> and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the
I mean, how many saw the victory at "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to opponents human beings."
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, available for everyone on your phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We taught these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year, we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, which can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean creating life <unk> for every single <unk> of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that thing that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of <unk> Three in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with covered with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
So the tip of the <unk> to Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as full metal <unk>
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got <unk> and made out of aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
We put this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy supply.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about caring but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spacecraft pointed out in the Earth, in 1990, after it passed away.
And I got a famous photo, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available not for 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen -- this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, he gave me permission to take care of his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any broken source of water -- saltwater, water -- a <unk> by less than two cents a gallon.
The Coca-Cola of Coke just assumed that I will do a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have complete trust that we might be, Coca-Cola is implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world in the end of 2013.
<unk> that Lakota warrior has better mobile communications communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And if you have a smart smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton was 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of abundance of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video -- video -- images, libraries of books and music, behavioral diagnostic technology, now is <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get in the health of your health care.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we are challenging the teams of the world so that we put these technologies into a mobile device with which you speak, and because it has <unk> you can get <unk> you can get blood from the finger.
In order to win it has to make better diagnoses than a certified doctor.
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in the middle of the world in which there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device was <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that doesn't allow you to call the <unk> and first of all, avoid the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give to the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, so connected.
By 2020, we spend two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds are never before you add up to the global conversation.
What will these people want these people?
What do you do? What desires do you do?"
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the biggest economic injection of the story.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D impressions and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion members of humanity, healthy educated and <unk>
What about some voices never before <unk>
How about it if we give them <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What did these three billion?
And if you are contributions we can't afford to.
One thing I learned with the X X is that small teams were guided by their passion with one of the reasons of course, to do things -- things that could only make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some already heard already.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university teachers among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it's been shown that today the machinery of human patterns pattern is better <unk> proteins than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me tremendous trust in the future is that we have more power to take for the major challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovator of the <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are inspired to work on the solution of major challenges and doing what we should do.
We have a few decades ahead of them.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
It's the point of departure.
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
They actually pick up fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it so much to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept: The waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could be <unk>
I burned so much with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The pond, was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, of those mangroves.
There was <unk> from about 20 centimeter -- the black beard <unk>
And the fishing.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped back in half.
I went to the five inches.
It is a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish are still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but it's all changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of the fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- I was starting in the <unk> Europe -- Europe was done many development projects.
<unk> development was to impose to the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat quite <unk> was called <unk>
I went to fishing in him, and we did study studies in the South China South China and, above all, in the Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs of these tiny things that are tiny <unk> remains of coral reef fish.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom line of being a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains what the fishermen collect every time you go to an area where they have never fish.
But there's no <unk>
You don't remember the world.
You start the starting point at the new level, it will not remember what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, we have <unk> biodiversity, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation of using <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and I extrapolate to it.
The difference is that they perceive the loss.
But they don't get the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the kind of changes.
And at the end to keep a few <unk> <unk>
And that, in a large extent, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they are anymore.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before you get it, it's thin.
You don't lose animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a huge loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
There are a few fish, but we think that's the point of departure.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientific scientists, which was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not the way they would expect that to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain of it, as I saw a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or generally doesn't use the scientists of the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that can be a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past people can't conceive of because the starting point has been running and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a marine marine zone and can benefit from the vision that we <unk> which allows them to erase their point of departure.
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the West of the West, for example?
I think that arts and cinema may fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there was gray whales in <unk> Bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were stuck with the movie <unk> talk about the story of <unk> why do you <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to <unk> make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> trends manager and look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we will see why videos are <unk> and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today, the web is making any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can become famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go over 48 hours of video to YouTube a minute.
And of those, only a small percentage is viral gets countless visits and a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video taken outside his house in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This chart shows <unk> at the popular rise last summer.
<unk> I didn't have to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that <unk> the <unk>
<unk> as Jimmy <unk> presented us with new things and interesting things and <unk> them into a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, you have to start on Friday.   Everybody wants to come on a week,   Everybody wants to get on the end of a week,    <unk> Friday. You will have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> squared is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular <unk>
Well, he took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators embrace a view of view and share it with a broader public accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this great internal joke then start talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way of being part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a repetitive animation with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year they saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that that is rare, you know that there is a <unk> version you've seen four million times.
And even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats to look at the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up among the Internet community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old one.
And then it was international did.
Suddenly it came up with a whole community of remix, that made this happen to happen to something that we all can form part.
Because today it's not only <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Black RS: <unk>
What wrong could have been written by that <unk> this situation?
In a world that you go up two days of video per minute, just that really only one and unexpected can make sure that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit that I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey Casey <unk> <unk> <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you flying properly for <unk>
KA: Thank the surprise and their humor, Casey <unk> I got five million you saw and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing that we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> creative communities of participation, all the unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- from a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of the audience.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities in the world, Justin Justin started on YouTube.
You don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics and it's just the current media characteristics but we have to embrace the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain.
<unk> for so much time, friends, now I <unk>
They become silent.
He died failed for the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother will never let me forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that history tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined for a task -- the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges fiction, a boat slid into the sea and dressed up <unk>
All the adults know the risks.
The biggest fear was the pirated rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who come several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to break for six hours.
But I can remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, he turned on the journey was too much to paint it, and the first apple that I made, and given for the men on the platform.
No apple had later the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, they were <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of class, which is <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants from immigrants from doing.
Unlike the middle class, whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English was <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a <unk> assembly line, working six days ago.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title at IT <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, wouldn't matter what was supposed to be, which was usually <unk> he was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform for the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
He was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother's movement.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares were going to be <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't do the politically and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> boys who were trapped between two worlds.
It got subsidies and <unk>
And they had centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student relentless student with what I would enjoy myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives -- <unk> by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many of them received help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I was elected my Australian Australian girl.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges were not <unk>
As <unk> resident anonymously was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that I'd never heard of, and in houses whose existence would have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the happy life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother, a mother, a mother ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single one and running down the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age that she had when she went up to the boat.
The "no" never been an option.
He said to me, and he said, "You don't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly talking, the more I was talking, to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of the possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a lawyer.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> new in the scene -- and not only is it okay, but it's something that is being grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was an energy there, a <unk> optimism, a mixture of humility and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
They went to a small group of people for whom the motto cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For one year, we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant soup pot that all of us did.
It will be <unk> at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we opened up step.
I made the decision to move to the United States.
After one journey.
<unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the <unk> adventure.
First of all, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared for.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 it became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support from his husband, he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause her, and so much more <unk> caused when I won.
It cannot be done proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the hotel room in <unk> when she died, when she died, I went to 1,000 kilometers in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw her stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple.
We tell the stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came to us and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked her <unk> "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given that we were and how life formed, we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would be easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that for it?
But I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy for the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, diving courageous in each wave, the steady pace of the engine, the vast horizon that don't guarantees nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and you can take them to a safe, it would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and they put in the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
And in that time, when the great prince warrior -- the great Indian warrior -- I was <unk> I made an arc and a <unk> on the floor, he found water.
Now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took out was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very much <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
And I gave myself this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't get it to my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow magic to allow the magic to allow the magic to do.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> <unk> was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it to be <unk>
We make our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came to this technological world to see how it can use to create magic, instead of <unk>
It was books from the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a <unk> device able to connect to readers of the whole world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.

<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what is that?
I'm just about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so --  It says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back to the book.
In a number of moments, you get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- which comes to me.
My inner girl gets excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean we have <unk> and dragons but the magic of childhood, and those ideas that were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to take the iPad and release the fireflies.
And, actually, they light up your way into the subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by as a child was a whole galaxy on a <unk>
So here, every book and every single world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all fantasy fantasy there have always been maps but been static.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect to me is to create Indian content and a contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that involves current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> glued to their <unk> they haven't come out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure that we have to go outside the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual we have to go out and in a chapter, we have a photograph of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have gone taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality, you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants.
And at one point the screen is full of <unk>
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature is <unk> with technology and magic and technology and technology is coming to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves in the natural world and that magic, joy and love of child that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I really think that the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to an director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she stood up a little coffee cup or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what you do, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they have failed to listen to.
This is my scale. It's a very simple thing.
It's got a <unk> on and closed off.
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to reach 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I got back, sends my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when I need care of <unk> or some urgency of that style, I was going to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 12,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and so that patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can help us to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control over their health.
From next week to be available for the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people who are <unk> from their homes, to take their blood pressure, take their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they become a position, they become the control and to be captains of their own <unk> but we can also help care of health because of the challenges we face as the firing shot of attention to attention to demand and demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to involve patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did would share with you with a video video.
We all have shipping controls in <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATM ATMs in <unk>
And where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We create a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please get <unk> where, and when it's open, you sometimes open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> <unk> to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks use their phone phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I want to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to <unk> the global level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Whenever you're on vacation and someone <unk> it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted companies to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in its place.
Please <unk> in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my passionate passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because I used to use the camera -- I was on planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk> <unk>
For me, photography had more to be on the right place, at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that I would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this: a construction in a very tight road will be.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful purpose but with the common goal of keeping <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way as a photograph.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be able to capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look real?
They're the details or the <unk>
I would like light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But in the end, it's our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we took different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if I exist.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's get to the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process when we combine the pictures.
It's really about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look realistic as realistic as I think are those in which we don't even ignore the things that are around us in our everyday lives.
But when we combine these pictures is very important to be <unk> because otherwise something looks bad.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images play with these <unk> were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and end of different images with perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image would go?
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed by photographs of different places.
And I think that it's easier to create a place that will find out because you don't need to have danger the ideas that have in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months to get them to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores of a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, even I made the house on the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to get an realistic result I think you need planning.
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and at the very <unk> time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please do you <unk>
Is it a diagram anybody I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, each step here represents an order of magnitude at the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk to you with <unk> curves -- is a new thing.
Here's something weird happening.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
It was more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we <unk> technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve where you say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to give you the diagram would look like something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if we ask for example, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a change <unk>
If the technology of the transport technology is as fast as <unk> last morning we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is unprecedented in the history of the technological development history that every single few years forward. orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- looking at these <unk> curves that are not forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We got one of two things.
Or is it going to become a typical curve -- I know like this until something completely different, or maybe I do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like that.
As that, we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, what is that new way you take the world?
What new is the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we are embedded in it.
I remember the future happen in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all that we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
We can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have much sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different to extrapolate what we are doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each one billion years.
So you go back about two billion years when the Earth was a big rock rock, with lots of chemicals that they <unk> around it.
If we see the way that these chemicals are organized by giving us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that's that, at that time, he had now floating down with oil <unk> with all sorts of foreign prescriptions inside of it.
Some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and that drops of <unk>
And they began to divide.
In a sense, those were the most expensive cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> they <unk> a distribution of chemical <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow it becomes better as better as being better at adding the chemical chemicals to make more chemicals and get more chemicals in.
They usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, chemical life, but things become interesting when these <unk> learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to store information, which was the recipe for the cell in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every single living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did only for <unk> We can write things with this code.
Here I have a hundred <unk> of white dust that I try to hide people's security people.
But I wanted to take this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and took it 10 to 22 times.
So if you want to do a hundred million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and it would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years.
But then another big step occurred in which things were going to be very different -- and it was that these cells started trading and communicating information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know it, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way we could avoid penicillin, and they would take them together to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are so many resistant to penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, were involved in that; and a <unk>
That kind of <unk> or <unk> together, or whatever if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came to come so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years old.
And at that stage we have <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as one organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or the muscles of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These are starting to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that don't make more than process in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures that we can understand and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not as much as evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn how to eat certain fruit, because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism given that before we had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
And so the fact that the nervous system built these data structures accelerated enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals found the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that we made some analogy with mine.
But we take a very complicated thing to turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do abstractions.
We now go through periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
So the <unk> the computer tape, <unk> <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we do before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of history that told them took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The beyond, the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And the beyond, like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that employment for <unk> would not be possible without recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me <unk> in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with designers, <unk> designers we think about a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine with that that does something that you didn't could, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using is the evolution itself.
So we put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these kinds of instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those of those things that are getting closer to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to tidy numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to opening numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them got it.
But one, luckily, it could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that they best did the <unk>
They put those and <unk> the rest.
And now we need to make the best ordered the numbers.
And we went back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs -- that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will reduce the property of both of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Tell me again.
I would take some mutations together.
And he tries to go back and try it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are absolutely perfectly perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
These are brown programs -- weird programs.
But they hit the <unk>
In fact, yes, I have the security that they achieve because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing it.
And he was once in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he took a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight.
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make a different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than normal engineering.
Yet we don't understand the whole options that we are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers faster and so we can run these programs much faster quickly.
I mean, it was <unk>
The thing is going faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are at an analog moment of <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what comes to you.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up a part of my fake concept in that.
Before I treat my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be out of <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you have heard about it.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of the game without being <unk> and that anybody who's going to deal with the first base -- not to get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really, well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody who's 10 <unk> <unk> four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player at the Mayor of <unk> to run more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I'm going to take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they include a surgeon who has also a <unk> record in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a distant place, and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and their family doctor derives to a cardiologist whose <unk> record is 200
But know what?
She's actually getting a lot better.
And your hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think of yourself that should be the average of a heart surgeon or <unk> a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, however, is <unk> the world, and I was included, with the term to be perfect.
And that never, ever would make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was looking at when I was in medical school.
I was a passionate student.
Once a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied was a blood test.
which.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the University of nurses at the General Hospital at Toronto, not far away from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of <unk> <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the fork of every artery that comes out of <unk> negative diagnosis and <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more <unk> more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if you were thinking everything, then you would know everything, or as close as you can close to everything, because this is how close to the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here in Toronto when brought to the lady in the emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I applied to a cardiologist when I was going to a cardiologist to go to that patient.
and to report to the chief of residents.
When I saw the Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which I was pointing for a heart failure.
In these conditions, heart leaves and instead of <unk> the blood forward, the blood is going to our lungs, and these are eating blood and so there is a difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work on the treatment that I would love him.
I gave <unk> and medication to alleviate pressure on his heart.
I gave him <unk> of water, so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in one hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I sat pretty well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more <unk>
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him so that he <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, it would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to get a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When he sent her home, I didn't get attention to a voice in my interior that said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so confident that I was going to ask the nurse to take care of Mrs. <unk> who is okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, "Yes, I think I'll be right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he signed the high, and the ambulance together with the ambulance ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, the <unk>
But I kept on my work.
At the end of the day, I went to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that time, I did something that I don't do normally, right?
I went through the emergency service of the way to home.
And there was another nurse, not that I was taking care of the lady before, but the other one, he told me three words, those three words that most of the medical emergency doctors.
Other specialists fear it as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: remember you?
He remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone as a voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
As an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the high school, suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance <unk> brought her to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a severe shock to it.
I just barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
They got a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after <unk> was in intensive care, and I was waiting for all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days later, it was clear that I never got to be <unk>
It had an <unk> brain damage.
The family gathered together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, he left her go. Mrs. wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
And the next weeks I was excited about it and experienced for the first time, <unk> shame that there is in our medical culture and sat alone, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't relate to your colleagues.
You make it the peace and never more made that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves teaching.
Shame is <unk> that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't because of my <unk> he was <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take things out and made sure that I didn't get paid.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made a <unk> <unk>
Why I chose medicine?
Little enough, that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, he opened the sky and finally went out the sun and finally wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I <unk> the efforts to be perfect to make more mistakes, I would remember those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work again.
It was going to happen.
Two years later, I was <unk> in the emergency department in a community north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain on your throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed up here.
I looked at his throat, I was kind of <unk>
He was bent by penicillin, and he sent him home.
But while he ran to the door kept on his throat.
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my chief asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made the three words: remember you?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in <unk>
Well, he went back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
It had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google -- it's an infection, not because of the throat, but from the upper foot, and that it can cause the close to those tracks.
He said, fortunately, don't <unk>
It was <unk> antibiotics on it, antibiotics and recovered at a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work and went back to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times as an emergency shift in the same as an emergency shift -- not <unk>
And this is a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were going to become 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I wasn't sent home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
I had an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out normal.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order to pull it, and I asked my colleague who <unk> him.
And I went through it, and when you see some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, he called the surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was interested in <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst errors in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
<unk> have been for the last five years.
They were embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't afford to talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to make the same <unk>
If I would go to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the errors of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust me that I would have difficulty looking at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
<unk> total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> that they make errors and the ones that <unk> the ones that don't sleep and the ones that I know.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we reach from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will stay a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism, I have done a bad research study, and medical journalism, I've done a personal curriculum on the first article that I wrote for the first article to the first article to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked on a system where mistakes happen every single day, where one in 10 <unk> drugs in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where infection infections are increasingly and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, die by 24,000 medical <unk> by errors <unk>
The U.S. Institute was set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiplying every two or three years, and we are not <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, take the same patient with a chest pain with my chest eyes, and with breath of alcohol -- and all of a sudden, my story <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same.
And my patients are not <unk> they don't want their symptoms in the same way.
All of this, the errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we were <unk> and we eliminate all of the professionals.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, <unk> art, <unk> is my worst <unk> I would submit to everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery <unk> "this is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> And I <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> to go down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> you can say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
<unk> <unk> is human, they accept it, they accept it, they accept it, and they're not proud to learn from what happened to teach others.
They set up their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We give the errors of other people not with the intention of <unk> but a loving way and support for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are running the system, and when this happens, they make errors in time in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I am human, we will make mistakes.
And I feel so much about learning something that I can convey to others.
I don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
Recently, I made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to pick up an average American -- are about 70 to a day.
Not a lot, in a research followed for a week to a group of companies.
And researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks for these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions about those assignments.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think of your elections.
Do you know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do we fix the way that deals with those decisions?
I want to talk to you today about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm a blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when I do a question, if your answer is positive to give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated at the time.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a park in <unk>
It was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water and this was when we were taking water from the <unk>
I loved going to that store, but one occasion, I asked myself, why did I never buy nothing?
This is the shelf from <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with his cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had different kinds of classes.
They took a <unk> just to the entrance to the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when I had a <unk> that when there was only six percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
So here we found the opposite effect.
From the ones that stopped when I was 24, only three percent came to buy <unk>
If there was when there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six, if they were six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we are probably <unk> <unk> less good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the lens of choices is affecting us rather <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we saw the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from a million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
And we were interested in seeing if the number of money <unk> available for retirement, the <unk> program will help people save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had plans that went from two to 59 choices, different choices.
We found that the older the number of hedge funds were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that would offer about 60 funding, the rate of participation came into the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for the people who decided to participate, the more the number of choices, more people are empowered to avoid the actions or the hedge funds.
As much as the more choice, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize your future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three key negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision that <unk> even when this is against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health care.
They're more likely to pick things less likely to pick up things less -- even though objectively they go better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that gigantic variety of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choose that awesome <unk>
Today, I want to introduce you to four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one form or another, in different research, so they can test their businesses.
The first one is, <unk>
You've been hearing before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, get to get rid of strange <unk> there will be a <unk> increase in sales, we will have a better experience in the choice.
When <unk> & <unk> I went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation Golden <unk> eliminated the products to express the products of cats that less <unk> increased <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and less costs.
You know that today's current supermarkets offer 45,000 products.
In a grocery store, there's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato <unk>
In the world of financial savings I think one of the best examples that have arisen on how to handle the choices is David <unk> David <unk>
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically at a certain of life.
The people who are really willing to choose -- they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They already know that people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that we have between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they won't be able to do their <unk> either.
This session, before we started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a holiday with all paid paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want the <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to go, and then I want you to give you an applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> OK. Anybody who is ready to accept the supply.
They are not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You know there was a trick.
Who's ready for that journey?
I think I really had to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first round, that in the second time, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were made to look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the lens overload that is <unk>
And so people understand the differences between choices, have to understand the consequences of each other, and the consequences must be very <unk> very <unk>
Why is people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when you use debit cards or credit cards that when you use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
That meeting is exactly how we were <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that we filed the staff to the staff that would think about the positive things that they put in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their bank accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of magazines.
We saw that in supermarkets, I wrapped along the corridor <unk> the exhibition of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But, you know?
Because the <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
On the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This <unk> scheme is totally useless.
<unk> must tell something to <unk> not the <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge fundraising.
You know who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think about if you just put it a little bit.
We need to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision, a car buying a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that enables <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is we vary the order of the order that the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors to about four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from <unk> four <unk> on 56 colors, a lot of choices.
And what am I going to <unk>
How much involved you are.
If you were always <unk> the flaw in each decision, this tells you that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to start, would take a default button and again, and another time.
The <unk>
If you go out of a few choices to many, many options continue there.
The same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order of information.
If we start with it, you learn <unk>
Even though we pick up the box of the change doesn't say nothing about the preferences of <unk> <unk> in all ways it makes us to choose from.
We are excited by a product that we're building now more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the lens of your learning, and we will eliminate alternate alternatives -- we can do it <unk> <unk> we can manage more categories of less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've been presented with were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who are going to work.
That is that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in Germany and <unk> if you had a typewriter to write it to the government.
I had to register a piece of text that was written with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a script with the wrong message they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much it will make it -- the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow dots on each page which follow a pattern that makes them own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be <unk> so much for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can set up attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your <unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that we had money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and so on, etc., etc.
These guys are doing their fortunes online but they do it by illegal media using banking to steal the money from our accounts when we buy <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a <unk> computer.
The secret driver of America, two months ago, <unk> account -- this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know his <unk>
And I say today is more likely than any of us is a <unk> of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they ask the protests, they motivate them to motivate them to motivate them to motivate them.
<unk> like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a leading role in online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do for money, <unk> as Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the national <unk> the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
It took the oil last day because of a <unk>
We took security on the site and <unk> a <unk>
Last week, I asked, in a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government asked one of the leaders if he was born, and I asked one of the leaders of people to cause people to cause the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how does people die, because of a attack of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do we do for the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority.
And that would give <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, actually, in Egypt the <unk> protesters at the Egyptian <unk> based on April 2011, and during <unk> <unk> they found a lot of papers.
Among those roles was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder was notes of a company based on Germany who had sold the Egyptian government to <unk> the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to governments, so that they do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
<unk> the connection to the Internet.
We have even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think hard about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like something bad, but it really doesn't affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be confident in our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to spend today, will be forever.
<unk> blind in any future government, in a administration that we could have in 50 years?
These are the questions that worry about in the next 50 years.
Here is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad and the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi doesn't have fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate in the park.
And predators, as the lions do, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one that killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only driver's <unk>
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up with <unk> a lot of lions.
People were dying of the warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even he was helping lions see the pen <unk>
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions to believe that I was close to <unk>
But the lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions did not.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch to light up and turned out the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and battery <unk> electricity into the small box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how you see lions when they come from night.
And the lights and put them back to the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses have heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> you can see the bottom, you see these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving very much.
And my idea is also used now by Kenya, for frightening to other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also using to leak elephants out of the farms.
Thank you to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
And I even took my friends to my community and set up lights on the houses that don't have them, and I show you how to fix them.
So a year ago, it was just a child in the meadows of the savanna, and the cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes flying and said that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to become an engineer in aviation and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a near CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented electric fences -- but I want to make my own.
CA: You know, I read it once, you know, <unk> and <unk> <unk> I've tried before, but I just got a <unk>  CA: At the front of the cannon. Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We're going to get it into every single step that <unk> friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we will spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Though I was asking myself about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until it all changed a sudden whole.
When I was seven years, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister from my sister.
What he said, "When I did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two past weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
I was the first time I heard people were suffering from my country.
And while I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in his arms looking at her face without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine in North Korea in the middle of the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and just a few survive eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequently the power <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, barely across the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is the limit between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river, right?
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life was like refugee <unk>
But soon as I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the refugees North China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination around North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was engaged in the police station.
Someone had accused me to be <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart went to <unk>
If it wasn't natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to wrap up.
But I managed to control my emotions and asked the questions.
At the end of the interrogation an officer said to another, this was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China seeking asylum in <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had very lucky.
Even though there were <unk> there were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight that hard only to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be done in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to take the <unk> going to South Korea by the world.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
And even I walked through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call my proud of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam of income to college.
Right when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities were <unk> some money that sent my family, and as punishment, my family was going to be displaced to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea, and South Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for over 3,000 kilometers across China and through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once our bus was stopped and tackled by an Chinese police officer.
He asked all of us all and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, and I stood up and I said they were <unk> I was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated and incarcerated for crossing the border illegally.
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But at the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come and forth between immigration and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What's the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would ask him to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without the <unk> the man went to the ATM -- and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for others and to take them out of prison.
I took my whole heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the people who were <unk> when I was more <unk>
And I showed that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village will be needed.
With time, after our family and I met my family and I met in South Korea.
But getting their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with some money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the English language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue to contact with family contact, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans go around the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Southern season.
This is the <unk> <unk> stores of fast, <unk> <unk>
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Central to represent something else, so they changed in Los Angeles -- as if this happens, what is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  <unk> of <unk> fast, <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other American others in a food desert, and Los Angeles Center, home of the food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to get kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases.
For example, the death rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I emphasize that this is happening.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of the house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see chairs of wheels and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of taking a 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters three,
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes to me as long as my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we got us together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- <unk> you know, nine plastic vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of temporary paid <unk> compound from gardeners of all of the entire city and completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone <unk>
The city got me above and summary I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I said, "Come on to me, right?
A criminal order for planting food on a piece of land that nobody would have.  So I was like, "Well, let's get it.
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> members who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> we went to success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that I was <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk> terrain.
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's 20 <unk>
That's enough space to plant -- millions of different <unk>
Why does the hell look like this?
It will take a <unk> 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, raise your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South America.
I grew up there. It was my kids there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Such a <unk> artist that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> on a canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the Earth can do.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witness how my garden became an education tool for my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act -- especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, which came up and her daughter was like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, and I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt about watching people who was so close to me with hungry, and this just <unk> why do I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't deserve that people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God, I'm not afraid they go to <unk>
So it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion where I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I gave her stories about how this had affected me and how they used to plant them with their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had 50 people who come from, and they work and <unk> every volunteer plan.
If the kids are growing up, the kids will eat them.
If you grow <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you're not taught how food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where you're stuck there, I see these kids that are on this path designed to them, that it doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington D.C.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plan. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take fire and turn them into healthy <unk>
I don't care about.
I'm not talking about free, because I'm free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want all of them to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take your <unk> right?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to stand with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me, you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with their <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> from the <unk>  You probably all agree with me in which this is a very <unk> road.
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in the days as today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we will have.
And especially if you go to your bike and these cars go up, that's not really nice.
Also, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like the Netherlands, very close to the cities, you would want a silent road.
The solution to that is to make roads from asphalt to <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the entire Netherlands, has skin pore and water can pass through it, so all of the rain water flow into the sides and you will have a road because it's easy to drive, and you don't get water out of it.
Noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, the whole noise in the disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the contents of this road is that you can be <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road the stones on the surface on the surface of the surface on the surface of the surface on the surface of the surface on the surface of the surface on the surface of the surface of the surface on the surface of the surface of the surface on the surface of the surface of the surface on the surface of the surface of
First of a stone, then several more and more and more and more, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and you can damage your <unk> and you can not be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create bumps with that.
<unk> She's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see what damage the damage hits this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light -- the light -- the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> and if you're going to become <unk> they will be <unk> and <unk>
So if you're driving through the road, you will take the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use <unk> steel wool from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel and heat the <unk> the <unk> flow out of these <unk> and the stones will move back to the surface.
I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big machine <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the exhibition, that I'm now going to get to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We ran a lot of samples out there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 feet on the highway <unk> where we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the road, and then of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know of practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did the samples, put a lot of burden on them, the rape of course, with our <unk> machine and the rape and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using fibers of steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, to actually increase the life of the road, they can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about whether this worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool it back first before I can show you how the repair.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC on his little gray radio.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual about those days, because the news is usually <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban took away from Afghanistan and made it illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to give my older sister to my older sister who could no longer be used out to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that nobody could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide books on market bags so it looks like we went shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us, in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we had our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, the school moved suddenly suddenly for a week, because the Pakistani Taliban were <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is?
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters got a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan, <unk> where his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It took away two years ago, just to convert our house home to girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk to educate your children.
For the years of <unk> I remember there were moments where I was very frustrated with our life and she was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can stop your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to do it.
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that's been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College here.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He wasn't only <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I carry it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I have a big dream -- but my family has even larger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> by them, despite them, even though even in front of a opposition <unk>
As <unk> it's not its real name, and I can't show you their face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the road from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> of being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
He got to his house, and they got the telephone, a voice argued that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling ones of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I think that these changes are not <unk> so much after the retirement U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who were pushing for them, I see the <unk> future and a durable future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities <unk> and every day <unk> <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never come back a revolutionary <unk>
They've been nearly two years since the <unk> revolution broke by the <unk> of massive <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as the <unk>
A forces with many other <unk> citizens inside and out of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, up to the west, all the way to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and some losses from about 50,000 dead -- we managed to liberate our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and seed <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society <unk>
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have to, with a lot of other women, rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a <unk> and fair transition to the democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation <unk>
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a <unk> period of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about developing capacities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> by the Peace -- a movement of women, leaders, a very specific orientation of the woman, and for our right of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> and <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was unanimously and successful.
Women won an <unk> of the National Congress in the early elections in 52 years.
However, shortly recently, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, they were <unk> every day we found news news.
One day we woke up with the news from the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their nonstop human rights violations.
Our society, made out of a revolutionary mentality is <unk> more, and it's gone away from the ideals and the early of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> the <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here at all here at all here at all the way that we have the success of the success of <unk> <unk> and the elections.
Now I'm here today to confess that we, as nation, as a nation, chose wrong, we made the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections not brought peace and peace and security to Libya.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> between candidates and candidate brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they don't.
What happened then?
Why our society is still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> as much for men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion and mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed the elections, which just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the feminine feminine and quantitative <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but also to put it into practice in practice, instead of <unk> economics instead of the competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, inspiring war, desperately needs to reach the end of peace.
Because peace has a alchemy that comes from the interconnection and <unk> between female perspectives and the men.
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> feminine and <unk> which spans the entire humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the towns have <unk>
And so, just like <unk> covers completely <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix.
So you say, "My mercy is all the things."
This is how he said, "My mercy is <unk> about my <unk>
They are all <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a disturbing, question that has an equally sensible response.
This is the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to do is that everybody is doing a good thing. Why is she left?
Why would someone go to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, no an expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
He was 22 years old, he had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times the man -- that I was creating my soul <unk> <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> with bullets <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> it with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where every year of millions of women, and even some men.
It could be your story.
I don't look like a typical government of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> at Harvard at Harvard University and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list <unk> <unk> between them, Johnson Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been doing almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, every races, all of the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence is happening to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse just happens in <unk> relationships and <unk> or said otherwise in the families, the last place to want or we would expect to find <unk> which is why, the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would say it would have said that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who read it, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of age 16, they have three times more likely to be the victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over 500 and more than 500 women and girls at that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and he started to start with me with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college of the <unk> <unk> and she was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that he was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me that I was ready to go to Harvard, who had gone to Harvard, I put passion in helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had done it.
And it was why the arts degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for my partner, but I thought that I had to do a job for your partner, and I put out my work and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was coming into head in a <unk> and financial <unk> psychological trap, ready.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those guns.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you are supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so secure he bought three guns.
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived in a small way.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message to me, and even though I had never been lifted up my hand, my life was already serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises from my neck had <unk> I put the wetsuit of my mother and married me with him.
Even though what had happened, he was sure that we were living happily because I loved him, and he also wanted me to get a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was simply a lot of sense of <unk> by the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and it never would make me sick.
I spent twice as much in our moon.
And the first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I went through a few times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey -- he was <unk> by traffic and dropped me a Big Mac cold, cold to the face.
<unk> followed by one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is whether of domestic and bullying at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control report that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man who was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that the whole world does is: Why don't you just forget it.
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and agonizing question that people -- because we were to our victims, we know something that you are usually <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of domestic violence in domestic violence happen after the victim is finally given to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to marry, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation.
And we still continue to ask why it's just not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it would have been.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone to the world -- the police, my neighbors, my friends and family friends, all strangers, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims of the victims as the headlines -- women who are <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
And so for some people is a way of saying "The fault is yours by <unk> as if the victims of the Muslim <unk> intentionally <unk> routinely <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also saying that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them, and that they provide their lives <unk> lives and happy lives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a <unk> of domestic and very typical violence.
I went back to <unk> with a nice <unk> and kind of kids.
I have that black <unk> and I have that <unk>
What I'm not going to have ever else, ever is a <unk> gun pointing at my head in somebody's hands who says I will.
Right now, the same thing is thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or they were being <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter to his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy particular love breaking the silence.
And I'm still doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse just silent.
They have the power of domestic violence, just shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse of the light talking about it with your children, his jobs, his friends and family.
We look at their vision of survivors as fantastic and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the language signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims of a safe <unk>
And together we can convert our beds, our tables and our families and our families in the <unk> safe, they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call this Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have any dress like that.  Luckily, I've brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of luck in it, I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when they were <unk> they don't have to <unk> now, but find him later on on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These students are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh out of me, so you don't do anything while you cover my mind.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope it's not as much like this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I would pick up the back and I would get the hair back to the guy.
Of course, with surgery or a <unk> <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for work, there are very little days to be able to do to transform our way -- which, while the superficial and <unk> has a big impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being courageous means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, because I'm a model of it.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my labor sector, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean nothing.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not just defined beauty as health and youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have it associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to use to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there's some <unk> of fashion that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for both of the models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City told every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, which is just <unk> -- that is less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always do is: Can it be a model when you get older, to be <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know about that.
But then what I really would say to each of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or an surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still said, "No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> of American American magazine or the executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's outside your control, it's surprising, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you see your studies, and you have a copy and some work on your back, you no matter what you're going to say -- to say, if you want to be president of the United States, but you know that you want to be president of the United States, but you know that you would hear Model <unk> for 10 years, people are weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, pretty much you get all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're going into personal terrain, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They're <unk> from a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is, we do things for free?
I have too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> and he jumped into a red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> I'm sorry, agent of being able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges for my look, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their self regardless of who they are.
I live in New York City and last year, of the teenagers who stood in and <unk> 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's about how many times I'm <unk>
When I investigate this talk, I found out that for 53 percent of the age of 13 percent in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up at 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people do is, how is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the louder hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe this is how you will.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative people, ingenious people.
And that's all right, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I am because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask yourself to be like, with a little bit more thin and the louder hair, it will be happier?
They just have to come together with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> and the brightest hair, the brightest hair, but they're probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to hold out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in our perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was most enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't know the <unk>
There were no <unk> and <unk> and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a little care on lighting.
In fact, they get them out tourists.
My story starts when I was <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He happened to come back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter was approaching me, my wife said, why don't you take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you keep the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists that were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a whole stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
And so we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a <unk> girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in one week in October and to make us think about our time and our evolution over the years, not just the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because even though we got the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceives and interacts with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the trips -- we were walking, when all of a sudden it was stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the grocery store that <unk> small on previous pages.
And I was described to the age of five feet in that same place.
I was able to remember his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what watches in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things that we created is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who gets out of the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to show up in the picture, and I don't want you to get closer to somebody and asked us to get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> birds.
First, why do you have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter as silly and silly characters, silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the printing press, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of diseases.
They're hardly <unk>   They're far away from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There is the <unk> of the New World who are mostly in <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank, where we have 16 species of these 16, based on a high risk of extinction.
So why do you think <unk> are important -- First of all, providing mechanical ecological services <unk>
It's our <unk> <unk>
It <unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that would not be for them to stretch and cause great losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers are taking three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge <unk> in the spread of diseases.
<unk> also have a huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and <unk>
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and <unk> his life to save the <unk> goddess of Tasmanian heads.
In <unk> culture, it's very important to be very important to open to open sky open to places like <unk> there's no place to bury the dead <unk> or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities -- they use this poison against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the endangered endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey to the livestock of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned by veterinarian in India, and they've taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there has been a spread on the number of dogs on the <unk> in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs have a huge time bomb, you have a huge time bomb, and the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market of <unk>
So what is they doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine the basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, and so to focus on a housing problem is not going to be anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these marvelous creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise.
When out of this room, they were reporting out of the <unk> but talk to their families, with their kids, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw them fly with no effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia. In projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we would <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where some Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we got <unk> seeds in the south of Zambia to this absolutely remarkable valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach local tomatoes and <unk> and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't know --  We were amazed that the local locally, in such fertile valley, had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible to do that we just said, "Thank you to God we are here --  <unk> to time to save the people in Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown up.
We got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a bird would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe, we were saying to the <unk> Look at how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red and red, at night about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and they ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here,  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought that only we were going to be the Italians who were doing errors in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what the United States was doing -- what the means, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You will see the <unk>  <unk> look at the waste that I give you to <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent about two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read his book.
<unk> from an African woman, the harm that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or are we <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture like my children, would you want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap on the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all of economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first first of the help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened up this conference put a cane on the floor and said, "You can -- you can just imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to just answer the 27 years to just answer people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anyone, but it will never be a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of local people, who have sleep to become a better person.
So what does you?
It never comes to a community with an idea, and he sits with the people in the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We sat down at a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we figure out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give a sense to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you?
The passion that she has for his own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So I had this idea: I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of reaching a community to tell people what to do, why not -- for once, <unk> but not in meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never give you a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance has <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in your community, you don't even know it, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work for one, and we work face to face -- you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family physician family, the business doctor of the business of business, which is set up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen, and that helps him find the resources to transform his passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city in West Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this condescending garbage in which we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of the story, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before I get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says is actually incompatible with a society and an economics of <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you <unk> privacy, has to be great to the <unk> and then <unk> will come out in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you talk about is this tomorrow?
local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial <unk> fossil revolution not renewable renewable energy, and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we make it <unk> <unk> <unk> we need to communicate seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a beautiful story that I read in a <unk> magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the course of the year, he gathered this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population gets growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk>  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life in New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States there were <unk> generic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. It's Henry Ford Ford.
But there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they're not going to come up with you.
Then you have to offer an absolute <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell is it has to be fantastic -- you have to count with a fantastic <unk> and you have to have a great financial financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can be done, sell and search for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked and looked at the 100 <unk> companies of the <unk> world, <unk> Ford, Ford, all new companies Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common -- only one: no one was started by one person.
It would never be the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
No one starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from an environment of small <unk> businesses in <unk> along with their dedicated neighbors who will do for you, what someone did for you, what someone did for this gentleman who speaks about this <unk> someone who speaks about this <unk> someone who tells you, what will you need?
What can you?
Well, you can <unk> Can you look for <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge even though sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and apologize.
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for cows stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It will always walk into the music.  There's a <unk> show in New York  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest American properties of America.
I live close to this house and I thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And this was a profound gratitude for the time that I lived in time.
He gave him clarity to the significant things in my life.
But let's try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up day and forget how important to one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house on a giant board on a giant board, and he painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before she died.
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflecting on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day, the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before he died, I want to be <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit on <unk> on the <unk> line.
"Before she died, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before she died, I want to plant a <unk>
"Before she died, I want to live outside the <unk>
"Before she died, I want to say it once longer."
"Before she died, I want to go to the <unk>
"Before she died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space has become constructive and the dreams and the hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving <unk> thinking and <unk> and of remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit kit and now have been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if we give us an opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distraction is more important than ever, to find the ways of preserving perspective and remembering that life is short and fragile.
The death is something we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that we have to prepare for death is one of those things that we're getting more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our spaces shared in shared can reflect what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media for sharing hope and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
It's not speak, but it makes joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> pass what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and mind in this: It's never <unk>
When I sing <unk> songs from our childhood, trying to tell me the words that I can't even know -- it reminds me of one thing: the little thing we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that must be the unknown.
Samuel has 16 years old. It's high. It's very <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year of my iPod -- conversations that we kept when I was four years old, and I would get a pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk> birthday.
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled me to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although I didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: that were <unk> and <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself differently, from there that <unk> be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of the development that faster increases in the world, there is no cause or known cure or known.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies, and in fact, it didn't look very interested in me at all.
<unk> and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I was pleasure on the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eating anything that I would have <unk>
As I grew up, it got more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child that I saw the world without biases, a human being that I had never <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, and when I wish they wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change by the normal.
The normal goes through the top of the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one single thing to <unk> and Sam and you, would you have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that we have, are a <unk> each of us has a gift in your interior and, honestly, the pursuit of normality, is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change die at the moment in which we try to be like each other.
Please. Don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> on the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher that gave a class of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> from these students with their great minds, their great books and their great unknown words.
But when those conversations, those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the hole in the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt like that I sat down when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening up that door is great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges and health care between others, and if we don't know what we don't know about this, work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for us, and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply that we study the <unk> but we study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when they're describing your science, care of <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them silly things.
Instead, as Einstein, said that everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when I present his job, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do about them, the bullets are killed, and the bullets are killed and <unk> your presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supporting too much in the language of our brain and we were <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of example <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> Tower of <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then give them charts that we would give up our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they <unk>
I think these are just key that can help everybody else open the door and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, for all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all over English is <unk>
Just because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor in the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who seeks a public charge -- no matter <unk> platform or principle, and that, when wins, I got it for the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the camera <unk>
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with <unk> <unk> named <unk>
He brought him into the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to face them, and eventually he had a popular support in London that won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use record of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, and his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There were all sorts of suggestions that they could have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was done with wonderful quality.
And not even with that was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed run.
And I could have <unk>
The whole world got tired and <unk> because this debate was happening for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> in this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want the Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it the King by if he did it or his <unk> ideas.
So, they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> more <unk> than it happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. It didn't invent the title. There was before before, but only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was Jewish presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but it was really a <unk> title.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign <unk> and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take a serious title with a <unk> <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> it was the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that as a government tells you that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep us waiting for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this, I want to suggest to you, is that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to note, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of UAVs.
The reality and the story has given the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness at the time.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy in 5,000 nuclear heads and so forth.
So in the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now they're the President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
Politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really change the most more words that they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters below the land in an Arab mine in Ghana.
The air is hot of heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch.
I hear voices that talk about, but above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and rocks games with primitive.
As the other ones, I take a cheap pound of light -- tied to the head with this rubber rubber pole -- and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that were holding the walls of that hole out of that hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
I was <unk> and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met earlier, that lost control and fell <unk> feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep at the risk of their lives without paying reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole and went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the G8 Peace <unk>
Among all the incredible people that I met there I met there I met an <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO that is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not to such an degree.
When we finished talking to me I felt very sad, I honestly was thrilled to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got me up to my stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even, they thought my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that there are now over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of African Africans during all this slave slave during all this slave together.
150 years ago the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual age of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
However, you can enslave entire families by generations by <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates over the <unk> of over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of them have been fooled by good and better school promises and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threat and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> goods produced by slaves -- they have value, but those who produce are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
It was in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their head, up to 18 at the time, and take them from the blast furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and tiredness work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no paper to eat, no to drink, and the severe <unk> made it to pee out pretty <unk>
They were so <unk> they were the heat and the powder that my camera became too warm to touch and left it.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning and do it work with air conditioning and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment better than these people.
Back on the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was at my hand quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and he trusted it to be <unk>
As soon as I waited to reach home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found a little baby baby rocks for miles per mile on the ground up to trucks that they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children and the kids who were using them to their heads with straps <unk> made of <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> <unk> completely home.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness of the world I would tell me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
I was driven by some stairs <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more a restaurant.
<unk> as being known in the craft, they are local for forced prostitution for <unk>
They have small, private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years old -- are forced to <unk> clients and to help buy more food and alcohol.
Every single phone is dark and dirty identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their <unk>
From the <unk> I remember feeling <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be caught in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where I <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no windows of big enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a very difficult subject, it is important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic, happens to us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, in <unk> in domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sexual soldiers.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there was entire families moving into the trade of silk <unk>
This is a family portrait of family.
<unk> black hands are the father, the blue <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these large barrels and underwater silk in liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, yet to be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a look fast.
I saw what it seemed to be a family of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families who are separated and forced to work <unk> extensive in these boats in the lake, despite not to know swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to come up with it <unk> which his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees wrapped up in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, and with fear, they get to the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them were <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
Because of fear of his love not going to flee and like all of life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it tries the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when we were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working on the way from one another.
And <unk>
And I can point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
I was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter in which the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes that possible.
Who will become because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
He took a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his motorcycle suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
He asked us to take it through a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were able to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started <unk> we took the <unk> that would take the way and after walking around an hour and we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photo of pictures about my head as I put out in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the road ended up <unk> in one of it, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they all were full of workers enslaved.
Many women had kids tied to their backs and while they were looking for gold <unk> with <unk>
The <unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in your own sweat.
I remember looking at his tired, <unk> because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have up to 90 feet and these people have got them to carry heavy stone bags that then they're going to be <unk> to another area where they put the stone to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to the margin we see working at the other less fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up as this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> by <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
By dying his uncle, <unk> "I inherit the uncle that force it to be slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the mines 14 and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and nevertheless, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with help from local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, you face a remote possibility that inspires me so much respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give up testament to them and we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines -- they're real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I would not think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force in which you see them, and I hope that that force on a fire and that fire light on the slavery is because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied math and there's a peculiar problem for the <unk> we are like the management providers.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
And we got the <unk> of the ballet <unk> and the dance of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But <unk> demands a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of the skill and probably certain initial <unk> that well can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's -- gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a <unk> dancer dance.
Over the last few years has been moved on in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is really a cure will be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement there are no <unk> so they don't make blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological <unk> for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of the clinical trials, they never do. It's never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could be made the exam they were <unk>
It would not be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinical clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as a conventional form of a chance, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration <unk>
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds when we can imagine it as a dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed -- the <unk> for example.
And like <unk> it requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about the time it takes a child to learn how to speak.
From the sound, we can trace the position of vocal chords as it <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
At the bottom plot you can see an example.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes <unk> and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they're both using existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears to mass scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce our patients.
You wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the <unk>
With high monitoring we could get serious data.
We could make a lot of low-cost <unk> for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when I give the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Women's Health Initiative.
<unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local <unk> local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> it can call low price and leave a few cents. And I'm happy to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So I just got to take all these samples of, say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yes, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to point if you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> You may not have it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data on different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion for the real markers of the disease.
TR: You have a <unk> of accuracy at this time?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to have done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works fantastic work and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network, also, what we do the project. We now have 99 percent precision.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the darkness, in rooms without windows and usually we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin -- the perfect skin is even more perfect -- we can make it possible and we can get rid of the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a true real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where I was <unk> there, <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 to <unk>
It's a small <unk> village in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The standard water level went over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers away inside.
As you can imagine, the people was devastated.
We get rid of rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> South schools. We took the slime houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of white fish, dead <unk> from the local farm.
We loved and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and <unk> cards.
They all did the same thing.
And we got to take them to different places of the towns around the <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that that people had <unk>
While the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help a center of <unk> in the village.
It helped clean toilets <unk> big, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the <unk> center will pick up the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that he was <unk> in me to hand out the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until far beyond my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some of them who had more than a hundred years -- some were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook, I contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started tinker with the photos.
This was the first of all.
He wasn't too <unk> but where the water had caught up the face of the girl I had to have a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl would have no aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as I had the photo <unk>
With the time of time, they got more pictures and they needed more <unk> so this is that he entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village north of <unk>
Once a week we used to use our scanner in the libraries in the libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, because of course the <unk> of the photos.
It could be one hour -- I could have a <unk>
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw almost by hand using how to guide the areas whose color and detail that the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures <unk> in seawater, covered in water -- covered with seaweed, even oil -- all of it with the oil -- all of it with the time I continue to <unk> that was an important part of the project.
We couldn't tweak the photo unless it was clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk>
We have a guide to a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more than the photos already <unk>
As once he said, <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of kind of kind of a relationship to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> she himself but stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have been able to reconstruct the images in a single photo and fixed the whole picture.
When I picked up their photos shared something about her story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble quite far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to shut down the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find her family and knowing that they had all survived.
The day I gave him his son his youngest 14 years.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could ever look at, something that he could get back to look at, something that I could remember from the past day that he would have been marked out of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, there were hundreds of them -- hundreds of them helped us clean up more than <unk> photographs -- the big <unk> -- the vast majority went to their hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to bring back to 90 hundreds of photos that were completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials, most of us in ink to <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a picture of someone or something, a relationship, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take for us but the first thing that we would take for looking for.
This was about the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone to your connection with the past.
When a picture like this, you give someone a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to some of them with something bigger -- I'll give you something, using your talent to something that is not necessarily thin models of perfect skin.
So I would just like to read this email and I sent him Cindy the day I went back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with different ages from the grandmother to the young child, <unk> around a baby, <unk> me because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> <unk> hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> was inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that ran through an apple on an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique so fast that it can create videos in slow motion on motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> over the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they really challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it on and switch it into a second <unk> or a second -- in various ways, you can create a time-lapse distribution of just one millimeter per millimeter over.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet does.
If we take that bullet and this distribution of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of the light in the light of the light in it.
Now, all this --   remember that all of this is happening in less than a <unk> it's what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light light.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into a bottle of photons that starts <unk> and that inside, start to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we start seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a <unk> bubble.
At that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the insights on the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, and after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we make it go the same distance and we see it in slow to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit down to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, it all year.
It would be a very boring movie,  from a slow <unk> movement.
And what about <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table and the tomato <unk>
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a composition of it.
But if you look at a more time this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light <unk> in <unk> is still brilliant -- not <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and light bounces inside your interior and comes back after several <unk> in a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera in the <unk>
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture of it as it comes to a little bit of light in a very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the most short, so just to get into something of light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, and we recorded over and over again with a very nice <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data on the crude and <unk> <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the front door. You get to the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and they put the light on the door.
After the publication of our paper in <unk> <unk>
And a fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good weather resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what it corresponds to the distance.
By projecting a laser you can record a <unk> picture, which you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, we will try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction of us.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going around the curve.
We could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected by open windows into the window.
Or we could build <unk> that can be able to see the inside of the body by having a lot of <unk> and the same for <unk>
But, of course, because of the fabric and the blood is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists that start to think about <unk> like a new modality <unk> to solve the problems of learning in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he himself a scientist, he became science in art, an art of photographs of <unk>
And I realized that all the data <unk> that we collect is every time not just for scientific visualizations but we can be able to be able to see that we can.
So creating a new form of computer photography with slow camera and <unk>
And look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just about <unk> of a second.
But here is a fun thing here.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
So it turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects  Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that the events happen in the world sometimes is invested in the camera.
We <unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and give you individual freedom.
With a cell phone you can put a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, it can go and get it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were going to look for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people <unk> that we were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who of the lights have a phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a <unk> <unk>
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone.
But today I talk about my mobile, and how I changed my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission on the E.U. was presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider of all Europe, has to store a wide range of information range.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the cellphone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and until two years, in your phone company, or your Internet company.
And in all Europe stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone <unk> and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets in Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany, <unk>
And I was also wondering if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> that then was the largest phone company in Germany, and please get rid of all the information that I had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer, and it was all blah <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a demand for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the end, he agreed.
They will send me the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD in it.
And the CD had this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 pieces of information.
I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life on this archive.
Was it a little bit <unk> what should we do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I am, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open City City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in, and you can go back and forward.
You can see every step I give myself.
And you can see how I'm going to show you on the train to <unk> and how often I call it in the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives you a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, and we talk a couple times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other to the other, and we end up with this great communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other, what time they relate to each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all of this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to who, who gets an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, you have a mobile phone in the pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I participated in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were, this never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe never happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to share it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you come home, tell your friends that privacy is an 21st century value and not <unk>
When you go home, tell your representative that just because business and city agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information do you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phones that comes to them to remember that they have to fight for <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why we would take all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it cannot be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus from my mother and not <unk> because my parents would be cousins, even though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that I came up at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration and I don't want any of them to be there.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
<unk> Christmas, are in the shopping center, drive in circles looking for parking search and what you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
Also, I mean, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York to do it.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy not <unk> but my parents don't believe in non-violence.
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters who went to public school, my parents would go to the school system and get rid of the school system that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all the <unk> all the <unk> the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk the five years to put in my feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used to use was to hang a dollar in front of me to get it to him.
The <unk> which I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten was walked as a fan champion who had received many <unk>
By growing up, there was only six Arab in my city, and they were all of the family.
There are now 20 now and remain all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a motto of campaign.
The people that I grew up with no problems with my faith.
But it seemed to be <unk> so much of hunger during the <unk>
I told you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating it, so I stop at dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I as well.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation at the coast of Pakistan, I was not going.
I spent my summers on a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were <unk> in <unk>
On the summer holiday I was often about <unk> so I was drinking milk on the back of <unk> so I was drinking milk on the back of the back Sea and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the key cure was yoga.
I have to say it's really boring, but before we do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it in my head.
My parents, <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to university through the positive discrimination and I got a grant for the <unk> University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the theater department.
They all <unk>
I did all the less intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene of <unk> my crystal <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow into <unk>
It's a play of a girl with cerebral palsy
I was a girl with cerebral palsy
So I started screaming at the four <unk> I usually have a <unk>
I have <unk>
In order <unk> Al <unk>
Thank God <unk> I'm finally <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater, crying and crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask her why and she told me that they would not do the risk scenes.
And I said, "Excuse him, if I can't do the stunts for risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role for which he literally had been born and was given to an actor without cerebral palsy
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors for disabled papers.
When I went back home, I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was just as extra in a <unk>
My dream made a reality.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I was there as a <unk> I didn't look more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the luxury directors, didn't understand actors -- not <unk> with disabilities.
It's just <unk> to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour, I took celebrity from New York to New Jersey and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he landed at the realization that it was going to high speed up the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral palsy with.
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic, in Arabic, with no <unk> <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival in New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and then to remind the directors, principals and <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight for the challenge of <unk>
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program on cable has Keith <unk>
I walked up as if he went to a graduate dance, I went to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the <unk> and I said, "Excuse him, you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I stepped on to the desk desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not just Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like my full-time <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that kids are <unk> but I never had a little bit of a girl or a child.
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I saw clips online with comments like, "Why <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What does it have?
We really should pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If somebody in the wheelchair cannot do <unk> then you can't make someone in <unk>
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
But of course I have grown up with media, I don't think they <unk>
I hope together we could create the most positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive images, that would take a less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a movie with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in the large state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started <unk> <unk> a charity to give kids Palestinians refugees.
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I devote myself to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives small people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes to there, there are no opportunities, there are no job, no <unk>
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he offers him to take it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, that gives you a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to their family.
They present a young lady.
They finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a car bomb.
That little boy in that little village with dreams of the great city, was terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were in the <unk> a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how about a child in a small town trying to fulfill his dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was <unk>
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future, and this was the first thing that came back.
This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call "the length of <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity for the opportunity, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities, the story of <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They're not doing anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember standing in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I never would have gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually in order to harbor some youth leaders in a business rate.
<unk> to about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a <unk> of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me that I was a graduate college college frustrated, frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to reach from point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He began <unk> motorbikes to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this different story?
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and harness a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think that the entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so quickly.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of the business forward.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if he wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from abroad.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up in the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a <unk> design company.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And the delivery of flowers for Facebook, creating gardens in the homes, and the companies of the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the young families can go together, and, like he says, smell the <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use lots of water.
So the first step is inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO working for government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
<unk> would believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas reality.
They need expertise and orientation to push them into development and put on their businesses.
<unk> the young people with the resources that they need, are the support that they need to move from understanding to the creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park <unk> that's how he called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids on the street to help rent and keep <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> paralysis of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation, and they have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace and <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains in the mountains in the middle of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it will not be on the way that we were born, we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> lake.
From the shed of the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> paper balls and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to take out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where it <unk> the <unk> who clean our garbage in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, and it is about 11,000 tons of waste and two tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I interviewed people in offices and interviewed people in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more.
So I began to work like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And they <unk> the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong one is rapidly <unk>
It costs a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept taking their weight on the weight of getting their body out of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the top-10 <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and moving into traffic all day and <unk> around you.
They just want to be <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker at work.
And also, the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you have to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a breathing or circulation.
It always must be movement.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that <unk> of waste are the most important workforce in the streets of city for three reasons.
They're the first protective health support.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the waste and effective every day, this starts to <unk> its container and its dangers inherent in very real ways.
We have been controlled by decades and centuries back, and they start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for how new the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's in danger <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just by pointing its relationship.
And then what I call our average speed is necessary.
With that, I mean, just at the speed that we used to get used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't get <unk> and we cleaned up or we take with us our coffee cup -- our bag of water.
We used them, we forgot about them, because we know that there's a labor force on the other side that it will take for it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste waste that maybe help to reduce the stigma and focus on that conversation about how to design a sustainable and sustainable city.
Their work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you go to it.
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us apart from ourselves, our own <unk> our own <unk> and that flow must always stay one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a garbage collection on the street, grabbed my little son and went down the stairs and he went down the stairs and there was a man doing his <unk> journey as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be right."
Shortly after that, I started to investigate waste collection and went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe it was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have to account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor hand.
The municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about them; they represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of your days and your lives, the next one you see somebody whose job is clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
I'm going to give you a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment that architecture born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought a couple of recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analytics from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us like my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
And after seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the coating coating generates heat into it, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the entire year.
And thirdly, your aspect has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted by the old market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in an area of much growth of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the picture, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, uniting all the inputs of the building.
And it extends out of a <unk> <unk> <unk> which creates an air in the open air in the building that would spread through its own shape of sun and the rain.
And around this space, we applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would be <unk> to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue like a <unk> concrete shell.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dress of the <unk>
They have fractal geometry and this helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled in the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that uses the light of the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas did not be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It was not what you get.
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center because in the end of the course there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings on the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof like a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are set up water to the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I made special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure of 1,000 years old as he was surrounded by a wall with a dozen Internet feeding wall.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets together by creating 12 similar building blocks on size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we selected some <unk> points in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and that changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in <unk>
And it is <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So let's take a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
It also responds to the local norms that they set up a greater density in higher levels and a lower density on the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving to the community the busy space for construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and pick it up, and do such a little bit like running a <unk> career, or jumping from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach in design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries where you can see the city growing up.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in life of people changes communities and local economies at the same rate that the buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of hair, very bright hair and a little <unk> of cute <unk> I was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year, and I was full of jealousy until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed a time after the school coming out of school, I was a little bit late and I was <unk> in the girls' bathroom.
When the shoreline was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took out of the table of my teacher <unk>
And then I did.
<unk> the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some such.
And I set up the book --  And I set up to give back the book on the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of these rows of <unk> and myself just a line of that, just for being there, because I was going on.
I still wonder what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came out.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was very <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was fascinated by the reason why I was bothered by that this little tiny little thing was so good for <unk>
<unk> jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies have jealousy.
Also, the primates.
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of investment killings in the United States.
And yet I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or sadness.
And so, you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which we study them in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's a exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, <unk> there would have literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king of <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
There is no Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, most of them have all of them.
This year is spent 100 years of their work, "In looking for the <unk> study -- the most respected study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> <unk> of mine, everything that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details that are <unk> right?
We think about a kid trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia Virginia said were as hard as <unk> <unk>
I don't know what the cat is, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, which is reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a good narrative foundation.
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
If you have <unk> and you audience, we know exactly what the details were going to be <unk> to <unk> the knife, right?
<unk> do all novelists <unk> and that's something that <unk> understand.
All that she does to give me pleasure could give us pleasure to the other, maybe right now.
And it starts to say itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- he adds it to his collection of instruments of torture in their private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a hard job, right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotional <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the vast amounts of hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --   <unk> links well the <unk> language with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of jealousy soon listening behind the gates and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know that this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with true <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to demonstrate that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, search for truth, a really painful truth in fact, to what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> <unk> -- these were the tracks towards the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman to whom we need, that makes us experience, it causes a range of much deepest feelings and vital man than a wise man that can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> are telling ourselves.
And there's some emotion that makes us open up in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement about our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity of such <unk>
Freud would write about this later on.
One day, Freud been visited by a young man who was being consumed with the idea that his wife <unk>
Freud said there was some strange thing in that man who was not <unk> in what his wife's did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing behaviors <unk>
<unk> <unk> or not, would you accidentally marry one man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
And the novels describe very well how <unk> do you look at intensity but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, the more we become the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent or illegal engagement.
<unk> are driving us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself for the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan of 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from the fact that they were sent to be <unk> awful to itself, for one year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend, I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
<unk> even though we get creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who try to do the jealousy, of our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom of jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to take from your own self and <unk> from what ever <unk> and it's under the floor <unk> your name, he takes your <unk> cow <unk> your <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
novels shows us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of <unk> rat <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But how they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Six of the Six <unk> once in <unk> in the Six -- once they were <unk> inside, all of their solution, <unk> comes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no one person in <unk> <unk> that I don't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> rushed in history. I think it seems to me very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to deal with them as a problem of geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're the same side.
Suddenly, you can admire that idea of being he <unk>
I could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can engage with it.
But I like the <unk> plans.
So as long as we hope that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only the fiction, <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> them to the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On December 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the <unk> on the top of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sea Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence on the gray surface of the ground was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization in peace days in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
died, including the Apollo crew one.
But before the Apollo show <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which was leaving after Armstrong was last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They did not be a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> the cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask, why does it <unk>
Why do it turn to our goal?
And you might also ask, why scale the most <unk>
35 years ago, why would you fly about <unk>
Why is Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the contemporaries, the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the most strong emotion was the wonder of the <unk> of the powers of technology.
It was because it was something great to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology's <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox <unk>
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle, but in 1969, the Apollo crew flew at 40,000 miles / hour.
From 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism <unk> of the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagined the technology would solve as going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or power to the world population seem to have a result.
I remember seeing the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the escape iron tube from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would have to see the colonies on Mars.
So that struck us with our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have found us, and they would have enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have extended and enriched our lives.
But it doesn't <unk> the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an explanation <unk> in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that you've created less ambitious companies that are <unk> from the years when they were <unk> -- Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused by creation of <unk> ideas by funding problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mainly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the capitalists of risk were at its high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment, chance they could go out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had problems to invest in technology as energy, that need a huge capital and the development is in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose to do not solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we were <unk>
NASA's even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would take a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from sources of renewables like solar and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want some energy sources of alternative energy that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, business and economists are according to what policies and international treated <unk> the development of <unk> energy, create a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of carbon <unk>
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see an energy energy policy, or the international treaties that reflects that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological, they turn out not to be.
We know from a time ago that famines are a result of failure on food <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or the systems for storage and exchange for food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't really understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war on cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need and we need -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, does it get to the bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and the dangerous, and there's no popular <unk> of science fiction like that of exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
It was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have a problem.
We are alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we are not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they become <unk> of our society.
I think that's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a huge decline of trust, is a very general belief, of belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and task, that I think gives you a more clear idea.
First, why do people think that trust has been <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I bow to think that it may have gone down in some of the activities or institutions and that might have risen in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can turn to opinion surveys and opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still inspiring the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they continue to be quite <unk> the horror of nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway away.
But that's enough?
What public opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is the generic attitudes that people find when certain questions are done.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at the <unk> teachers.
They probably <unk> by asking, "To what?"
And that would be a very sensible response.
And you could say, when you said your question, "Well, I trust some of them but in other not."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of a <unk> official or a person, is going to be a uniform in all of them.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give you the kind of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my favorite friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop all of that knowledge when we think about trust in more <unk>
I believe that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real standard of real confidence, because they're trying to make the good judgment of inherent judgment when you trust something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> of not trust that it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who devote their savings with the very rightly called Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say it says, yes, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about making a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the raw subjects and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they aren't unable to trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but not to do it in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very confident that they can do certain things, but I see it <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I haven't got <unk>
But that's what we're going to be <unk> before trust.
Trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build systems from accountability for all sorts of institutions, and officials and others, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, <unk> the problem is that it takes more time to make the administrative <unk> which will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and I think that the system of accountability that is destined to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do difficult tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You know, all of you have similar examples.
And we got all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were going to be worthy of trust and encouraged to the people who are reliable and whether to determine whether other people or politicians or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's trial, simple actions, <unk> which is not done properly.
Third, the task.
Put the task to rebuild the confidence, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, trying to improve trust.
But trust, in short, is defining because we give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough for them to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't ignore it, usually to all people, all the time.
But you also have to give <unk> evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That goes every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions -- very effectively.
I'll give you a simple example.
The store where I buy my socks on, he says I can give them up without giving explanations systems.
I take them and get it back and get it back to me for the color of the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing for is not very hard to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early early computers we have come up with <unk> the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> increasingly and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I wouldn't have any <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
I first created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to pixel down.
Designers can make their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs below the screen.
So with this tool <unk> the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of the hands?
In the <unk> division of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
It was a transparent bombsight with cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, get into the inside of 3D space, and pick up pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the archives have a location in the real space -- it's so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can look through the book and highlight lines or <unk> or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down the floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the roles and we make the digital data to us?
We had a lot of us bought and put things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted in your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just looking at pixels in space, how can we make them be physical so that we could <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the Media Lab, I had my tutor in front of my tutor in front of me and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this one single physicist.
This magnet <unk> is behaving like a pixel in 3D in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
So what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation and <unk> mechanical <unk>
And when you program digitally is the object -- we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and a distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can play as a physical reality sometimes that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating about changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities every day.
And you see, the digital data is not just showing us something but start to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without we have to <unk> our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if we suppressed that barrier, the only limit that you have is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China in the <unk> years.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to teach a school to athletes with all the overhead payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believed firmly that there was just an <unk> path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether I would like it or not.
But my dream was to be an opera of Chinese opera.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
Until I wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends -- but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved looking for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what the first books were going on here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> about Chinese <unk> life.
And it's not propaganda a <unk> convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told myself, "It's so different, and so much better than it was.
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also led to my reading habit habit.
<unk> many perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me because this is what the students in China learn.
There was never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There is to research fields like religion and comparative literature and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers to a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in real life?
So I started to read books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and <unk>
By Buddha, it's all of us, lust, fear and the duty <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> road <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it is through the translation that I realized that <unk> Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to come back and feel like or powerless ever.
Having a broken sleep, it's really nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of sleep.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams come from, where the passion, where the passion, of where happiness.
A broken dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to books, that today I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> stumbled on the couch of my office and took off the shoes and told me that he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could manage it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy just to move your head while I would take it to the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> I said Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start working after that, and she has children later on, and it goes to death later.
For <unk> like Alex and I had time in <unk>
But shortly after, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yes, he is coming out with guys under his category under a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe you get <unk> on the next.
Also, the best time to work on Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel the head after what they did, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in its development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and it had real consequences, not only for Alex and their loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk> everywhere.
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population -- or 100 percent if you think that nobody comes to age without spending before the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! You're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take away a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to the 35 years.
This means that eight of each 10 decisions and experiences and moments -- that give your life to life will have happened to be 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change yourself, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top at 28, and things become complicated <unk>
The <unk> are the moment for <unk> on your body and your options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and the attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday and common life has an impact on the person that was <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers are talking about changes in the time of adulthood.
Researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
journalists were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't that true?
What do you think happens when you give you a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and no happens to be nothing.
And then every day, every single day, <unk> really interesting <unk> like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this <unk> relationship.
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are by <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had better copy the day I graduated from college.
And then he starts going to sound something like this: "My dating dating was like the game of chairs.
They were all running, but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and everybody began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but not the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things to <unk> there's a huge pressure on the 1990s, and so many of you start a career, choose a city, choosing a family, and having two children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that begin to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle of middle-aged age, it's not about buying red sex cars.
It is to realize that you can't have the career you want right now.
You realize that you can't have the son that you want now, or you can't give her a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you look at yourself and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At the 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but we still can't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living a lot of <unk> very difficult, his previous life had been even more difficult.
They often get in our <unk> but then she woke up and say, "You don't pick your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for nearly the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the entire morning <unk> with his many relationships, but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the English words, "Please call <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot to resist and I wouldn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the 1950s.
So over the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma to get rid of that crisis of identity and <unk> of identity.
By identity, I mean, do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital generates identity capital.
So now it's the moment for the work of the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that shouldn't count, that by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that I was <unk> jobs and I did it.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited as to who you know, what you know, what you know, how they think, how do you talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who gets out of almost always comes from outside of its inner circle.
The new things come from what they call weak <unk> friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the way we put it into this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> so knowing the chief of your neighbor is how you get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
By the end, but not least, Emma believed you don't pick your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon invited his family, when I have a partner and it exists their own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit up than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to pick the person that you live now or you're going to tell you now when everybody on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you do, and that involves being as intentional in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it to work or kill your time with whom we choose them.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a <unk> <unk> who was working on a art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That offer of work gave her a reason to leave the boyfriend with his alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and I sent me a letter to say, "Now the spaces of contacts are not <unk>
<unk> story may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like airplanes that come out of the Los Angeles, which come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light light on its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, the 21 or the 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> who heard of.
It's as simple as I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get capital capital, using your weak ties.
Don't let them define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years, I left a very hard job in management consultancy for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in New York City public schools.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I give you assignments.
When I went back, I went to grades.
What struck me the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance had no I.Q. scores <unk>
Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things that you need to learn in math in seventh grade, sure, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure <unk>
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a rapid and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We are trying to predict what <unk> <unk> on military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> <unk> and we tried to predict what children are doing, as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> professors working in really difficult <unk> and what teachers are still teaching me for the end of the year and of <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the outcomes of their <unk>
We partnered with private businesses, ask yourself, what from these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, it came up with a characteristic of a major success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is embracing his future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a big career.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my job questionnaires and then waited for about a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination to be even more likely to be <unk> even when they were <unk> in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of testing -- even the security people who felt the kids when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where it matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for children at the risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How can we develop determination for children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a solid ethical <unk>
How do I keep them for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent will not be <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are simply not ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly determination of it is not related or even related to socially talented choices.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk> of growth."
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when you die, because they don't believe that that will be a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a big idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to start to start all over new with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> <unk> is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the figure of the Chinese characters.
From that time, I was amazed at this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can take away this <unk> so that whatever you want to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence, in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
So we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 of them will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read <unk> menus to understand the basic idea of music or newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if it was shouting at <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way. The one that makes them work.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> <unk> in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
These are building blocks so they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, <unk> two are company, three are crowd.
If you reach out your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a beer like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations there.
You put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> you remember, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two jumps together, it's very hot.
Three links together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door, you put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> had someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're careful about <unk>
So we've already gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this method the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters would build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred <unk> which is the same as learning a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the <unk> we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the <unk> sun.
This is a sun placed in the origin, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the first one, created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains on the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become out.
A mouth that tells you where it's a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and start off the stage.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie mastered his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a bright wand of it.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of industrial complex fantasy fantasy <unk>
But the magician magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took to be 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal guy, and a <unk> boy <unk> a girl dressed as a guard guard on the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a huge difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence on the magician magician.
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the Oz magician is doing today, the magician would say, <unk> are the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
<unk> shoes to defeat the armies were generated by the <unk> <unk> computer.
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing about the magician magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started seeing this when I did about Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a child.
About three years old.
It was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the surveillance level was <unk>  And so slid in the room and he was impressed like a mom and he was impressed like a mom with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would it be value issues, resilience and <unk>
I should feel that Luke <unk> one military to topple government?
So let's take this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you win Dorothy -- your movie?
We do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to be <unk> and not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force capital F, force in movies for our children, and so little on the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence movies in girls, and they should be <unk> It's really good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know that the Princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first <unk> I really hoped that I would start to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focus on defeat <unk> and get your reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, and to defend the Disney <unk> for any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though them, the guys, are not really their target audience.
They do a fantastic job by teaching girls how to defend against <unk> but don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and charming as <unk> and <unk> but don't stop being a war film.
Of course, the most successful topic of all times continues on appearing on classic after classic each one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and her son, or two men who raise a girl.
Until that, as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what criticism was when he came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's really good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't been able to be roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comics, in comics, and in the '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, there is more than a female character who has line?
So, you have to get the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point in movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the kid as much of the kid than you like.  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet I really rarely see it in the movie we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> from <unk> success -- an idea of consensus of what is a movie of quality.
<unk> is not the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie is happening in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the hostage.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the big time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular movies -- how many of them think they have <unk> <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women have recently chosen for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a larger number that this room is going to be <unk>
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, is.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually <unk> ever in their life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics -- one of the things that I think is there is a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do you do not <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to beat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our willingness to be <unk> <unk> and we hope that that will happen, but I have to ask you, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their own power.
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily by parents.
I think we have to show our young men a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of <unk> and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite baby was from Star Wars <unk> you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories when I tell my <unk> <unk> and fight only and more stories where I saw her work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people improve and being better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to look at them.
Yet over time, I was <unk> to <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of nearly 1,300 miles away along with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
So to try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to do differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in simple sight, seems to be brown but when we use infrared and process it using fake color -- suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the <unk> landscape by building materials and the <unk> activities and <unk>
I want to share with you how we have used satellite data to find an old city, old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for more than 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art and architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> per mile away.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, she moved into this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> <unk>
And I'll try to find you at random it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with <unk> eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of it, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this is slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we're looking for layers of human interactions.
Five meters down, under a thick thick <unk> we found a dense layer of ceramics.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date from the Ottoman Empire exactly the same period we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs -- shock and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones in the jewelry welcomed -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry workshop who demonstrates that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we would take place in a near future for <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire -- it's probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share the knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So I mean, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas have really happened in 1984 B.C. in a lost city -- not for a lot of time and found from high.
It certainly puts the <unk> for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door <unk> house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that he's made.
Now I <unk> a group of <unk> <unk> in bicycles.
They're racing on a <unk> race race and go in the direction of their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk>
They walk against the door of your house.
There are <unk> flying everywhere, wheels on the side of the wheels on the wheels of the wheels that end up in the <unk> places -- the threshold of the door.
And in the lobby, or what's on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with his hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks to it.
You can feel your blue fur, you tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you think it's about to get into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and come to your living room.
In the room, and making the maximum use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
She's with little clothes, dancing over his center, singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now I go to the kitchen.
The ground has covered with a path of yellow <unk> and from the oven come up to you <unk> the <unk> and the Len of <unk> of <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that has been conducted every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers just once.
We had the names of tens and tens of strangers.
I would give you full poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize most of the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I said, "You know, when you realized when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition is saying that they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques invented and 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that the medieval scholars used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English, although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live in national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem that's amazing.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed us to see what extent our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent a afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a number of treaties on writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having an idea of having a memory of <unk> and <unk> <unk> wasn't a thing as rare as you might seem to be today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, they will provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed the Earth, and I would say that we have changed any cognitive form.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems to us to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a <unk> and <unk> memory is this singular competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of University University from London invited to a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it having brains in a certain way, structural or different <unk> of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference between the brains of the memory memory and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI machine, <unk> their brains while <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in memory champions are different parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or seemed like a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There is something that we can learn from this?
The tournament in <unk> <unk> is driving as a armed race where every year comes up with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times champion of memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> which he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he does.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise precise order of binary binary <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these drugs, absolutely all of the technical techniques at the end of the way that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates it with a elegant paradox known as the paradox -- <unk> <unk> says this: I say two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his name.
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them, <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
What do you get?
The person who told him that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person said that their work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything to you. It's no relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance on your head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> white hats.
They have flour <unk>
They were fine when they come home to work.
We probably know some <unk>
And when I <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this comes back two and two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says, there was a poet called <unk> which I went to a <unk>
They had hired him as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, not brought to a <unk> he was going to get a <unk>
He stood up, he had his memory poem -- and he was <unk> and so soon it was, <unk> hall.
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everyone else, but it shattered the <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting.
So they could not be <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
I was standing out of the outside, one survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where she had been sitting every here.
I took the <unk> of the <unk> hand, where his loved ones were <unk>
What <unk> <unk> at that time is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or <unk> of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you were to tell me that the first 10 words of history I just told you about <unk> it's very likely to be able to do it.
But I would bet if you asked them to say who I was sitting on the horse speaker brown in his lobby, would be capable of <unk>
The idea of the memory palace is to create this building with your eyes and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> of memory <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make a talk and want to make it from memory, the same way that I would have done it, if you had invited them to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely <unk> <unk> crazy image to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering his house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that <unk> anecdote that you want to count.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that I would talk about would be that strange journey that you did for a whole year, and you have some friends to help them remember it.
So it's like the <unk> speakers -- <unk> their narratives -- not as a word for a word, which is going to confuse us it's typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in your memory memory.
I saw this that was simply fascinating, and I got <unk> on that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an event, boring.
Really, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting sitting on <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing about it is when someone was <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know that there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I have no access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in her place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes all the way to sit on the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a market of <unk>
And I found that this was entertaining.
I would never have to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train the memory.
What is really about doing is to make better and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are trained to be able to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard <unk> team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security goggles -- covered with tape leaving just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could online, in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment was coming out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and <unk> phone numbers and shopping, but actually this is not the point.
These are just so only tricks.
Because it's based on quite basic principles of how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be building <unk> or memory <unk> <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply into it.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
I added a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most people are not <unk> around.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there's something that I want to leave you with today is what <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me to myself, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
So how much are we willing to lose from what's already our short existence on <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks into our side, we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even bother to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you have to be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we can just think of a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from boss, I was six years old and lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there you all spent the time watching television -- so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me, and every time I was <unk> and I went back and I went back in one device, and all of me looked at me.
And I was like that.
It was physically, not sure and hated it.
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of these emotional <unk> connections that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's no wonder that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want to think of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it for based on a building built two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an extraordinary emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who build <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know are going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the <unk> Public <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, it has a <unk> it has this thing round -- columns, red -- that drop out of <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called <unk> are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms of life.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so we move away from people.
All of the black, this is all <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no other choice.
We have to go to the other side and come back with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> we make a swing from the back to go ahead and over and over again. And we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago <unk> the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small on a <unk> scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we began to incorporate those symbols.
It <unk> the <unk> in the other direction.
We take those shapes that we know and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added cake. and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into a <unk> which can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes <unk> won on audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of the buildings.
It's crazy.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved into the slums, and there, in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or <unk>
Maybe with an infinite range of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
We architects feel frustrated and we start to make the second again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the <unk>
We have the symbols on the <unk> now we have new design techniques, <unk> design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is <unk> and <unk> and it's super <unk> You're totally <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk> happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical academic and public <unk> in general, were completely about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
tourism in Bilbao grew up in a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Cleveland,
Everybody wanted one, and Frank was everywhere.
He was our first <unk>
But how is it possible that these forms of wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous throughout the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennium country happened with other architects star.
And I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few of these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to pass through all of the architecture.
Imagine, for example, how do you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't really take a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 other buildings, before we know what I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> movement, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen. Because we are at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the invention of the iron and the elevator.
My theory is that when the dawn of communication applies to the media, start to swing increasingly fast, and it will be on both extremes almost <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the audience.
We can now make <unk> symbols with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a holiday community.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already part of the community, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the product -- the finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community that first summer, when people began to get and they shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not just images from a building, are the images that you made from the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and to carry these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but that they changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians from <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> the Internet looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what it can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> and simple drawings -- and you are no longer a <unk> public who doesn't accept something that has not seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't stop <unk> for architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of a style to another, of one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick based on ideas of what is supposed to be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that you're going to produce.
That means that the buildings will become the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking lot in Miami in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sports or to <unk> or even you can get married at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the East Coast of New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we've built is.
We architects already know how to make more ecological and more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we are no longer in <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and working together to make better buildings, better cities, to a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give it to the <unk> spaces, local libraries the households where we formed our kids, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
He just turned a year and he started walking.
And it makes it great about that great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at it in the mirror.
She really loves her <unk>
He <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, "When do I try to do this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't taste with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people search for Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenage teenager, it only wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week at school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, despite your mom to tell the whole time that's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Among what your mom tells you, and what his friends or colleagues say, you don't know who to believe.
So it makes a video of her, and he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others who please leave a <unk> "I'm pretty <unk>
Okay, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a healthy and normal teenager who receives these answers on one of their life of their most vulnerable emotional life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate in this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young as young.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from the hand with that is <unk>
This environment of being always connected, it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of how they liked and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no division between a life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is <unk>
What is the most important thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a context every day?
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> still remain <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And the trends like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> it, <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like those of the superheroes of sports, and the singers, <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we surely want our children to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the picture, we are teaching our children to spend more time and effort to figure out how to look at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like your relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects begin to be hurt.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings, and as a partnership of society development and the labor camp.
And 31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the discussions of class.
One of five are not <unk> at all the time in the days when they don't feel comfortable with it.
And in the season, if you don't think that you look at good enough, specifically if you don't think you're good enough -- you get a note on the average of your peers who don't care about how you appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it turns out irrespective of what these young people are.
So, so that I'm very well talking about, we're talking about as you see it, not how you are.
<unk> in your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, eating less fruits and vegetables, involved in more diets that can take them to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol <unk> and drugs, diet -- aesthetics, aesthetic, sexual relationships to early ages and without any protection and damage damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether they have no greater <unk>
Fifty percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, which would be that opportunity?
It will create this potential is interest in each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first is that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-worth.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I stayed very impressed by when I learned that many <unk> programs without realizing it, I had the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow is not only a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are key points for anybody who would be willing to provide education in body self-esteem that works.
A education is <unk> but dealing with this problem requires each of us that take the reins on the issue and be a better model to continue for women and girls in our own lives.
It's challenging the current status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell the input of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people by what they are, not as you see it.
We all can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to change our culture, so that our children will grow to be valuing their entire person, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
Let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out in the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the better version of themselves, where the way they think they see is never going to be <unk> that they are, or reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
Her <unk>
Could it just be the woman who is at two seats, and what would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, that he would tell you for no long legs -- <unk> more skinny, and a smaller <unk> feet <unk>
What would it mean for her, if we put this up and make sure that you unlock that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is holding back to all of us.
But let's give our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you look at yourself is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
They go to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And to work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that small <unk> of a year of age today, they become agents of change in themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
You initially found him innocent as that, but being prisoner by other minor charges in others, they began to plan attacks to about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N. headquarters and the U.N. headquarters and the U.N. headquarters and the U.N. headquarters and the U.N. headquarters and the U.N. headquarters and the U.N. headquarters and the U.N. headquarters and the U.N. headquarters and the U.N.
And luckily, those plans were <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who had an engineer who had a <unk> mom who had a <unk> mom who was both made for giving me a happy childhood
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
By experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to understand the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all of human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are so attached to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible media so that everyone lived as well.
A few months before arrest he sat down with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and a few friends, had been going to training shot into Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> shot <unk> which, without our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot was gave the little orange light on the goal, and to surprise us, especially me, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to others, and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, as a child.
And all of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what it seemed so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put 700 kilos of explosives in the north parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and <unk> to another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability in my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to somebody already <unk> and left another city.
As I was always the new face of the class that was often <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new class of class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not developed social skills, to say <unk> <unk> for growing <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera to people, based on <unk> indicators as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I tested my way of thinking about it was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program that I participated in the National Convention in <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a <unk> victim -- almost all of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids we had done friendship, was Jewish was Jewish to us.
I took several days out to the light that detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I'd never had a Jewish friend of mine, and I was very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that my life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> a park in <unk>
I found myself with people of all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All of the life was taught me that the <unk> was a sin and for extension, all the gay people were bad <unk>
By a chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critical that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is a homosexual but I know what is going to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
Every day, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and I was helping me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with character.
In many ways he became my figure <unk> at a moment that I was desperately <unk>
On occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while she's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who's suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a chance risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, some day, who is going to take the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better path. That even though I was brought to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, because the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
From terrorism victims of terrorism talking against those acts without sense, as rejection to the actions of my father.
With this simplicity I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that kids don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this point there is a film that is projected on their minds.
It's an incredible film film.
It's in 3D, and it has sound <unk> of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has color, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your <unk> your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like the moments of your childhood that I project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thought.
The movie of the movie is you who experiences everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner film, tea, you, and you.
There is nothing we know more directly.
At least I know that I have a personal awareness.
I don't have certain that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we were not aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we do to produce the outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
<unk> that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, is objective of life.
<unk> consciousness, is subjective ...
So there's never a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, that vision.
The psychology was studying <unk> behavior, and neuroscience is a <unk> brain -- but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The science of consciousness in the recent years was the search of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this guy in the fantastic work I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling <unk>
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations for.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do certain areas of the brain and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
In fact, there is no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it's not addressing the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The normal <unk> are all of these emergent behaviors, how they operate <unk> how do they work <unk> how they behave and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how to work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a phenomenon <unk> how to figure out how we speak, how we have <unk> all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the difficult problem, is the question of why it's all accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a materialistic scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> which works for a long time, hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But in the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to get us on this point.
We have a powerful explanations chain, which we get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision in the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our vision of the world, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that are at first, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the inner transformation includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the <unk> functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and this is all studies of everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to it.
But I'm going in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe like <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, they are considered fundamental, and the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you cannot explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- <unk> space, <unk> laws of Newton. So I applied the basic laws of <unk> and applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space space, time, mass, then for a matter of logic, you have to add a list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the awareness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it is not an object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other core concepts space, the space, the <unk> the physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say we want the fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> by mind, each system is aware, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think of God, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of crude crude a precursor to the primitive <unk>
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How did anybody think about something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it is <unk> like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more continuum with nature.
A more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that we think about thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
There is always information processing -- there's consciousness.
<unk> of <unk> complex <unk> like in a human, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple information simple, simple consciousness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> took this kind of theory and I developed it with mathematicians.
It has an mathematical measure of integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And they are supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration a high degree of <unk> lots of consciousness.
In a mouse there is an amounts of information integration of information, as significant of consciousness is pretty important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of zero.
In fact, <unk> a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying it.
As Stephen Hawking "Where does the fire come from?
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave you as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the consciousness is the one that puts the fire in the equations.
In that view, consciousness is not found outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision, has the potential to address our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some may be <unk>
I used to think that I had nothing to have to eat anything that had consciousness, so I had to be a vegetarian, I had to be a teacher.
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you will get too hungry.
I think I think about it, this tends to transform your vision, while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the information, she has an information processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have really serious ethical problems that are really serious about the ethics of the development of intelligent computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of collective collective people, the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, as the audience at a TED Talk, and right now, we have a TED collective consciousness -- an internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that should be taking seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
Actually, I'm safer of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is something fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, that's probably this most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to resolve it overnight.
But I think we finally will come to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low education.
I went to school, I went to my friends, and I was obsessed with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take a community prize for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very beautiful, but there is a problem without saying.
She's actually not achieved anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I wasn't doing anything extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school in a high school of <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the class 11 minutes of <unk> <unk> a guy lifted up his hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
And I said, "What's <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs. They talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this boy had had experiences with disability with disabled objects.
And we don't. And it's not <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair and probably you are waiting for them to be <unk> Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here to be <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lying to disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital capital <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability, makes you <unk>
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make <unk>
And over the last few years, we have been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl I was not drawing with a pencil holding through the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber <unk>
And there is a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn term <unk> because we have a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> people in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad for me, it could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been passionate about strange <unk> to express that they believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this would happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I got to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those images are attached to people with disability in terms of people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something hard.
We have a few things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things that you might think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was <unk> by the so-called social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society where we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability to do it, and that's what happens to the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside of the common.
They're just using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to be <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says as a compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that the disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh my God, you're not going to be inspired by anything inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know that I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
Yet not <unk> that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> of <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to carry your cell phone on the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn about force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that has been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a pole has never made it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen, not going to be the <unk> for <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching the <unk> <unk> not considered no <unk> of nothing for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement from disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a <unk> of 11 degree in <unk> is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
<unk> does not make us <unk> but questioning what you think about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to do is augmented reality and professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today, I just answer one of those questions, so please don't <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think of "Minority <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
Augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the reality of it.
The first step, this is what I've been doing with the Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets them see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what's a professional <unk> in the countryside.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you <unk> with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what's running through the game of play to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a little bit of a hundred pounds of us <unk> us trying to <unk> everything in its being.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
I would take a few videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the <unk> because the idea of the NFL, of the emerging technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment -- a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field of <unk>
You have noticed that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue 8, Blue 8, go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be your favorite players, and they've asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how we take it to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that many of you already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why by this video video.
Man: Oh, yeah.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain <unk> for his life.
What is the experience of a fan of a fan when you take a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be a <unk> experience.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> he launching the ball at the bottom of the network? or <unk> making a <unk> <unk>
What is your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 cents as a suicide skier.
Maybe the <unk> <unk>
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to <unk> <unk>
It would make augmented reality when the <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a quick refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> they put a little faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to do it.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NFL, he put radios.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming to your group and you see her next one you are shown in front of you, in a plastic <unk> that takes <unk> you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
It's the strategy.
It's just going to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose their instructions, they hate to lose games.
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of adaptive strategies.
Augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do?
Now, a very simple option would be to have a camera at every single corner of the stadium, having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get the sensors out of the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all of that information is going to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
evil will have information overhead.
This is going to give the good people to the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the analysis of data will stop being just for nerds.
It's also going to be <unk> Who would <unk>
How would it be in <unk>
Imagine that they're <unk>
It takes the ball and <unk>
They go to an open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you are going to <unk> Normally, you don't know it, but the <unk> system is <unk>
It's been <unk>
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open Amazon.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we could, however, the receptor sees in its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The <unk> public and fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do lots of people check it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want your favorite player.
Augmented reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just like bread and circus, like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally being on the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it worth <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face -- as always, from us.
Thank you.
I was recently, after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years -- the extreme southern country -- the south end of the County <unk> which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer chief parents to build the bridge said that, "The bridge is basically <unk>
The suicide of the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a <unk> of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks down the bones, some of which will provide vital organs.
Most people die in impact.
The ones that no, usually they fall in the water and then <unk>
I don't think that the people who are doing this method of suicide is given to the death of the death that was <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
So here is where most people are for before they get their life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its darkest time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this photo last year as this young man talked about a mate looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we have successful that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, Swedish officials and psychologists train to the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him about 22 <unk> last year, when I got a call from a possible subject, a suicide event, sitting in the <unk> near center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to Jason talking to the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason was just 32 years old, and I had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent the Earth to the Earth with a box, and said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out with <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind of clever and clever kid in New Jersey had just taken away from life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how I was.
<unk> parents had the order.
<unk> damage is affecting a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved it out <unk>
What do you say?
What does it say?
In my experience, not just to speak -- but you need to hear.
You will hear to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you don't have fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is: <unk> in the similar circumstances have thought to end up your lifetime, and you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do in <unk> social isolation, and a lost amount of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son the 19 of January, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and blessing that <unk>
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It has to be a whole experience in there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will not come home.
Mike was driving to San Francisco to see the 49 percent of the 49 with his father the 19 of January.
He never got there.
He called the <unk> police and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported to me that the car was below the bridge.
A witness I had seen it jumping from the bridge to the afternoon to the late day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong before without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a ticket through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk on the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean by hope and value.
On September 11, 2005, I replied a radio call by a possible subject -- a suicide bomber on the sidewalk <unk>
I took my shot on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he immediately crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
And during the time and the next year, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
And Kevin decided that day to come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
And when Kevin came back, he <unk> him.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that made you <unk> and <unk> the hope and life.
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I'm <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing erase the events of September 11, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin follows with us.
I think Kevin was <unk> by help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We thank God for you.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she write, <unk> when I went to General San Francisco Hospital.
<unk> I did have to <unk>
Today, Kevin is an active father and an active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and his depression with hope that their story inspire others.
The suicide is not just something that I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, in spite of finishing their own pain, theft the opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they would not think about hurt another person.
They just want your own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls about the bridge.
From those incidents in which I've been directly involved involved just -- I've just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked to him about an hour.
And for that time, I was blown away by hand.
At the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped on the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said to the second one of those people have said that the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I say to people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also to people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be able to get to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There is help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but inside your interior you know what you are, and a question remains: How do you get you into that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in no way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I had felt that I had had ever achieved the dream that I had ever had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> my inner truth, with my myself.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to refer to later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, I'm just starting.
We are all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of our skin color or the beliefs that surround us.
These are people who always defy the status quo -- what is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent -- ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I signed up as <unk> as I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always had this shirt on my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why do you always take that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to fix it.
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but we now know that, really, it's a more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never told myself to share my story, not because I think that I am a bad wrong, but because of how the world is trying to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have my mom and Dad and a family who embrace me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15, when I was 15, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> <unk>
He told me that if she was <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> and the <unk> And that night, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> among over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was queen of beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I was <unk> to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that it passed my request for the green card that I could go to live in the United States.
I was <unk>
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, and I like to travel and be an queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities, in Thailand do do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license, and the gender <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity <unk> means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me I was license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
And I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman from New York who <unk> his truth, but that <unk> put his life to life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
And all 20 of November we make a global vigil through the <unk> <unk>
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who were <unk> and he stood up with the injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help each other to live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no longer <unk> from 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
You will do this?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. First of all, thank you with all my <unk>
My support network, to my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been to young people who have been <unk> who have <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't take it, and I took my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's not just gender identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us gave us a gender to birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table the topic that sometimes it doesn't block, and what I'm trying to do is to put a space that would allow him to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There are still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you will be my allies.
KS: Thanks.
In many people who are <unk> and tribal societies, they are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who meet her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education for his rights in 2007. And when he went back into his efforts in 2011, when the <unk> National <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I had a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when we were born a child, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome by his father, nor for his mother.
<unk> next is his <unk> to mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother <unk> a lot of a child.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first child, the first child, gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, it feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just stem mother, but the daughter. The daughter just <unk> when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays home and the school will admit to his siblings.
Up to age 12 in a way, has a good life.
Can you be <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when he gets in adolescence, when he was 13 years old, you forgot to leave her home without a male.
It's confined to four walls in your house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the name of his father and his brothers and his brothers and his family, and if you put the code of that course of course that they honor could even kill.
And it's interesting that this idea of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more norm of <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the best.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepting the decisions of their father and their mother decisions even if they don't want it.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like it, or if you put it with a old man -- she has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens at the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then it gives birth to more sons and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson for his children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters when <unk> was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a legendary <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> all of these were men, and I grabbed my feather, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when I was four and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yes, I must <unk>
They can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of your identity and his name.
One entry to school means that it has gone into the world of dreams and our aspirations where we can explore their potential to their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of parking, Canadian and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in no document.
That was the reason that value to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters to his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence of my daughter.
I went to sit down with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to show you in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values on my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They were <unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of the BBC, she offered her himself for the New York Times, and he talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and the October nine of 2012, he was shot in <unk> in the head.
It was a day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, and he would tell me when I heard my wife -- <unk> <unk> by what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't you <unk>
It would take a fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace because of the cause of peace, and the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that stayed on the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm fine with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to do good. Please do not <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters have learned from how to resist at the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women -- it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when I don't have a job.
They fight his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What special about my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion to me.
I'm engineering.
I want to tell you that recently, I've joined the Google <unk> where I've had a <unk> of Google <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> Google <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get into a brain surgery.
You are still equally smart or not?
It's not going to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the middle that creates some important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to take away from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide to decide about combinations of chemicals, and trying to get them to live with life.
More than once I've saved a little bit.
But fortunately, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to stop them to try to get the <unk> dose because there really isn't a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started testing with different <unk> and I stayed amazed at looking at how small changes in the dose changed my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried and I tried an typical chemicals for a man of <unk> and I was surprised to see how my thinking changed my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person in the whole world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several types of that, or maybe some versions of it is <unk>
It turned out as an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much of it, fixing a problem that he had on the front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to do -- I've been better with the men.
What was trying to be able to look at those hormones and these hormones and these hormones and so on, it was to regain my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I used to think about almost always in pictures, and that became my key point to the key reference -- how do you find those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and recreating situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> as <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like that.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are people who are <unk> this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the minds works, for me, is simple: for most of us, the mental imagery is fundamental to <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and well <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental imagery from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director were able to use his imagination only to steer the world that has <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music in your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two recent groups that are made in neuroscience.
And both of these used technology to be able to call a functional MRI.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The center of the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with a lot of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual <unk>
So let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of reactions from the brain to video sequences.
Then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as much as a new <unk>
The computer, using only the brain brain information would take it back to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're pretty close to doing it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you can imagine that same picture, you create the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scanning systems systems available today, and their resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we get it?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I didn't give you that.
And so many of them are proposing new projection techniques, and even I <unk> with the recent outcome of <unk> first we have to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets, but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer little improvements in the resolution, not gains for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger <unk> make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a large amount of effort on MRI was to make a really big magnets, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever and brilliant solutions to <unk> and <unk> in the byproducts of <unk> radio receptors in MRI <unk>
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, <unk> <unk> patterns <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing patterns, we can increase the massive information that you can extract in one single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers, our growing knowledge of the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood of <unk> but the hormones and the <unk> that I mentioned -- I mentioned and maybe even even direct neural activity. This is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas directly to the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices to open up this door.
Anyway, pick one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not just in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet may be telling you some person for the first time that your love or tell somebody who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have in life.
So all of us are a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet to be universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be <unk> that by the <unk> of my pocket and because I had <unk> my head -- I was doing a little bit, I would usually ask a kid and say, "Hey, you're a guy or a <unk>
And there'd be a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit longer, I would take my coffee with a leave of <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother <unk> a cold look at his son.
But I would never say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
It's a family silence, but this time I was prepared and I was just about the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a snippet of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took a deep breath, and my backs went down and my backs -- a four year-old girl with a dress -- looking at me, which is not a challenge for <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a guy or a <unk>
So I took a deep breath, again, I went out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is confusing stuff.
I have the short hair like the one of a kid, and I saw her clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a dress and pink, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
All right, I'm more than a <unk> <unk>
And that little girl looked at me, paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he's got a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all about it, "Oh, you are just a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest thing for everyone ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in <unk> and I, both of them were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
It's like my closet not unlike yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons why I come out of my closet.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to somebody who has online <unk> is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that story is harder than saying to your five-year-old son that you're going to be <unk>
There is no hardest thing, there is only hard stuff.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to be difficult to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we should just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and shoes of <unk> high.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight any child four years to go into coffee.
I was frozen in a corner of my <unk> <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, and it just move a muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends, complete strangers who I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would turn around purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you will kill.
One of my most memorable launches was on my sister.
It was the first time that many people who were invited to know that I was gay, and when I was doing my <unk> <unk> and <unk> walked around the tables and I finally got to one where the friends of my parents, people I knew I was doing years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried -- <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and it's never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our singing program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in expecting her support, to get me to know that I was on my hand, finally he said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt.
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you get.
It's like the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask any one that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> your armor. Be yourself.
That girl in coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others have to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Sean <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, you <unk>
If you say to your parents that maybe you might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that might change.
Don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and most important --  Let the complex are.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be <unk>
And some of you can go out of safe, <unk> so they have done, but it's never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- an productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submersible can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to pioneers of computing as Alan Day.
And so, a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a walk.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from an alien race that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth and the Earth of Earth or the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible lives, and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept of intelligence on Earth, you would see it required to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet, stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I took several years ago, I looked at a variety of topics through science, through various disciplines, that I <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately adjusted to developing intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in a robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different subjects and <unk> together, I asked them to be several years ago: there is an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we could extract from all these different <unk>
There's just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of one E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a strength, F, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open choices with a T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, <unk> to an imminent time, <unk>
In short, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping open choices.
And so, having in account of this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
So how did it <unk> it?
It <unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, I'll show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have trend to conditions more favorable for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection is <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of long-term entropy production, but actually arises directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that can be found in.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple animal testing, play games of humans, and even earn money <unk> actions, all of that without the right thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided for its balance <unk>
This ability of balance will have apps for robotics and human care technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate by pulling extreme lengths of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a model of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning, economic planning, in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a <unk> game against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where your friends are constantly constantly keeping up and keeps the network of the connected network.
This very simple network of network also has applications in health care and health and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> <unk> strategy in a simulated array of <unk> <unk> and successfully increasing assets under their advanced management exponentially.
These risk management ability will have broad applications in finance, secure things.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of <unk> cognitive behaviors such as using tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here is a deep irony.
Let's go back to the beginning of the term of the robot, the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we were <unk> smart machines -- there would be a rebellion <unk>
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all of the concept of rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not that the machines are first becoming smart, and then they try and try to take over the world.
It's the opposite, that the urge to take control of all future possible is a most fundamental principle than the intelligence of general intelligence, the general intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to get the descendants to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at an inflection point in human history, something between <unk> and losing the planet we call <unk>
In the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth works, in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting around other stars, which points that the Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint <unk> of stars when planets go ahead of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that you get to us.
The data gathered by Kepler actually show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
And together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small, <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also how much light they get from their <unk>
Instead, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure. of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
2014 was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia from now is now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on the global scale has <unk> our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a science scientist and no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in finding life in the universe -- I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the <unk> planet and the planets that we know about our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world shown that for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past, and in part, it's why we study both Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking its surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission are taking samples from the atmosphere <unk> and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
private companies now offer not only short space flights but also <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all these <unk> images, remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still stay in <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and <unk> places on Earth, air is cool and full of oxygen flowing through our tropical forests at thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement about the colonization of Mars and other planets will get a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars will expect there to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
And so I like to be able to be able to look at it, I am in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to safeguard humanity is as imagine that the captain of the Titanic will comment upon us that the <unk> really will have place in the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for climate exploration, and preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of <unk> to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> <unk>
Only they're closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile areas and moving spaces, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a <unk> experiment, the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, having in mind that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life to now.
Well, where are they?
Now, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations are becoming advanced advanced enough to consider to keep living among the stars, lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we're going to develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only <unk> colonization will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to compare to the hostile environments of Mars to human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were in the dining table, where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and all of them were closed.
I thought to call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to go, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend from Jeff to pass on night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I <unk> my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than a <unk> to half night, so I thought, well despite the circumstances, I was right there.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how brain brain works.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate will raise the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to <unk> <unk> at the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in place that were going to be <unk> that were going to happen.
Or at least, if you're going to happen, bad things -- the chance that it is a total catastrophe there.
So I went to think about that, but until a month later, my thoughts were <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was a little embarrassed to read the window, and a little embarrassed to read the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I'd been practicing something called retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts coming up and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and then try to figure out what can do to prevent things to be going or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some of the things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious one.
In the house, it will take a place for the things that lose easily.
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the problem is, where the fish are where the fish are, where the fish are <unk> where the tribes are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find your nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find his nuts.
They weren't using smell, but the hippocampus, the very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car keys, <unk> and <unk>
So in the house I put a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular drawer for your passport.
For your <unk> a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it, you will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of your credit card <unk> license, passport, <unk> mail to themselves so they are in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> it can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases your consciousness.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of the practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best moment, and we have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our health care, or a dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very specific medical condition.
But this was <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical decisions and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we have to take from the one that would benefit an rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease attack, heart injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, you are even likely to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do so, a statistic that you should ask for the fact that most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's to <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit to surgery at any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you must think about what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not <unk> and if it's somebody's fault -- it's from scientists like me.
We have not understood very well <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs work just about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before to help a person?
300.
This according to the research of the researchers cynical <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was exploring the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 to go down my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a third statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
For this particular medicine, the side effects produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> muscle pain.
But a moment.
remember, under stress you don't think clearly.
So think of how we do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 or side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug that will help you.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I'm just saying you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
<unk> the need, is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that the most is done in the older men in the older men in the age of cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
That's how 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about before the questions that you might argue that you would take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice, a lot of times, you want a healthier life out of pain, or a longer life that might have much pain to the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change it in the heat of the moment, but at least one is trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at the time is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predator, we don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get the lunch for the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is kind of rational thinking, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail to eventually fail again.
The idea is to think about the future of how they could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that helps to minimize the harm, or to prevent things wrong in the first place.
I went back to the snow night in <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor I settled on a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the front door, in the same one way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't <unk> and lots of text messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see organization like a <unk> process and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite symbol of music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch <unk>
Two more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousand and thousands of <unk> I can never have a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade in 1800, and with the time of time, it mixed with local shoes, and developed the language that we know today as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize this is not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, it's really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, living in a world of sound, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following the blind of their rules, we would hear behavior and rules without <unk>
So how do I understand this?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how the people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure they don't <unk> the covered in <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is going to come next.
Hence this cartoon is.
<unk>
It was going to be <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign of <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic residence there.
Before this time, she had worked as <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to be more than art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that we don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound ownership and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me about sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I began to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
And I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that well I could tell myself and my artistic work, or I could be <unk>
I chose that I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around the language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I had no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and to become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions and institutions, work with lots of performers <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask for <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value as well as you take a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If I won't continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to get it into the forget and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound as my new artistic medium was <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and the <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same is true of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a bit of the piano, so they understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> is divided into many different <unk>
If you're assigned a different <unk> for every finger while it hits the piano like facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed of the hand, and so while it hits the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you were <unk> just a key at once.
However, the <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in order to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If just a key would change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of <unk> <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk>
This is the <unk> sign on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lens <unk>
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all the day."
If you look at it, and you look at the visually speed, you see it as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel like the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time -- I would take a again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm with four times by <unk>
But when I look at the word <unk> I think, I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Watch <unk> right hand -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands in high.
Now we're going to do it as much in the head like my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a story is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, a third. Please get it back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job of all.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in my head and the chest. But they transmit meanings very different.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very rough world.
And just because <unk> doesn't have sound automatically -- it doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allowing <unk> to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And perhaps people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a treasure trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to take you to open up your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "You can do it all, but then you have to <unk>
Food involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence from an innocence or a bubble from ignorance to say, because the adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults are also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean up the other people.
The time -- now I'm an adult and invention and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk on the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, cleaned up the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the ocean -- they contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and collecting those pieces of plastic to study it under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it's hard for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We begin to build this <unk> work with <unk> so that the kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools is cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to engage them in something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children get a lot of a lot with robots.
Then we started to quickly create what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick, in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned out the light lights, and we turned it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating down through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of the <unk> to get a estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
It took this one invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else gets it, even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> they're trying to fix it.
I can investigate my problem with <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
You see the news the news, you look at the Internet, and it <unk> with this image: <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest world's forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water you drink -- it's the water in which you put the water where the water is going to live.
You can also see that the water is brown and the mud and the oil are also brown and when it's all <unk> it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can push through all sorts of things that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help a remote way to help other children.
I was forced to do a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe I could address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half the Japanese and French half and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that began several giant waves that began <unk> and those <unk> brought several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, nuclear nuclear plant close to water.
And today, according to the reports about 300 tons are still <unk> of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure the <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems to be that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast, and the majority of time, it has certainly safe -- it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and investigate independently with other scientists, the land, the ground, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we reported to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they are going to have to live with <unk> all their life.
Together with them, we discussed the data <unk> that day, and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to render data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain towards the <unk> and <unk> system in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this organized an civil expedition, the nearest close to the date.
We get closer to a mile of the nuclear power, and with the fishermen help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and we built them.
So here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been beginning to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal, a little bit of biology, of optical biology, basically you can build almost all there.
It's also a place where adults can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy?
For example.
Or we can help in mobility of the elderly people transforming their standard wheels into new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So, citizens <unk> we need to prepare the next generation for people to care about the environment and people, and so that I can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other time he believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> marble he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool of <unk>
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smaller units of life, the cells, we took all the information on it for every cell to work and to make it happen.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> of different parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins is thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with small <unk>
One acts mostly like filter the other mainly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that moves gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a split screen, which represents my vision of the world -- twice the personality of every designer and an architect working on the work between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine, between the machine, and the gene, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere is shown in the two screens after me.
My job at the simplest level, it tries to unite these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible to do this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare time, where four disciplines that offer designers access to tools we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, and tools and tools and tools and tools through scales, large scale, like this robotic arm with an scope of the diameter of diameter with a force base that one day is not very far <unk> and graphics <unk> made out of genetically engineered <unk> that glow in the darkness.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every Himba is a single size to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion chair with <unk> van <unk> It's like a second skin made out of a single piece, which was made of a single piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with collaborator of 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and dry 3D skirt on the cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this very high resolution, and the <unk> instruments allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the very comfortable structural chair and also <unk> sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator, went back to the nature of <unk> and when designing this pattern of surface surface it becomes <unk>
<unk> this <unk> surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, changes its functionality not by addition to addition to addition to other material or another <unk> but <unk> continually <unk> and <unk>
But it's the <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious <unk> but when I was young, my grandmother would tell me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what it matters.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God shipped to the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, twigs, leaves and <unk>
All the tree was <unk>
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world <unk>
And I often ask myself, "What would the design look like if objects were made of a single part?
<unk> to a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the <unk> material, the kind of material of the tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year for organisms like shrimp, crabs, and <unk>
We think that if we could <unk> your properties, we could generate structures that are used by one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical <unk> we have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, tough, <unk> to the light, soft and <unk>
To print the large-scale structures that we built a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material and create these structures made of a single half material -- 100 percent long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, you can dry it up to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process of printing were used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed genetically to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems to <unk> and if it broadens even more to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first life forms on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made out of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed to make <unk> put in the sea, and put it on the sea, they will help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we should dominate the bacteria and control your <unk>
So as the <unk> <unk> we made our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> made by <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the alchemy of liquid biology, just that instead of <unk> metals -- it would be <unk> new economic growth within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, you get two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and on the golf water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces biofuels to the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
So in order to contain these relationships, we created a single channel that looks like the digestive tract that will help us to bring these bacteria and to make it as a function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material in the material of the <unk>
If we wanted more to <unk> it was more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, it takes 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our very close intestine.
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> and bright channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are long-term creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design is <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increases matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin <unk> the damaged tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer is actually made up of layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates highly sophisticated architecture a home within which they were <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, by putting those fibers together.
And this is happening through scales.
The silk worm first turns into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
And tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm.
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch not within a box, we realized that <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different environments, different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape of the composition, the structure of <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms are to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we could shape <unk> silk without boiling one single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we got this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot doing <unk> and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that worms are <unk> into darker areas and <unk> so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, distributes the silk tube over the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to engage with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and while they were <unk> <unk> and they would get <unk> and the life starts again, like us, but much, much longer.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
<unk> silk silk about quantum ampullate silk gives up all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little over two or three weeks, we <unk> worms for <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the skull of silk.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give the products to the products and the buildings that are around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers have to bring these two visions of the world.
It takes us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new age of creation, which brings us from a design inspired in nature to an nature inspired by nature, which demands us for the first time, we have in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they first asked them for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and finished websites and finished websites -- he also played the guitar.
Maybe you've heard of us.
And generally I like to test and persist in every case, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of maintaining this sense of, that's no longer a challenge, gets to <unk>
And I have to let it.
But then I got closer to something else, something totally different, and I get excited about it, and I get <unk> and I feel <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I should choose one thing, deny all my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
The other reason I got so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for not <unk> at all.
I was worried to be afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where we did it in culture.
You ask ourselves first to ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would be at that age.
It's considered a naive question to trigger cute answers in children like, to be <unk> or to be <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done over and over again as you grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are wondering they're going to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of what the dream takes us.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, it's not inspired by dreaming of what they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults may be <unk> and say, "Oh, how cool you <unk> but you can't be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this <unk> Amy editor went into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do with something that you have to do for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and to devote your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There is no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel itself.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
That's a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> <unk>
It could help if you divide it into three thick and <unk> potential.
You can also use other terms that we would take the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time of the Renaissance the ideal was the ideal who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
Do you think of any term that you like or you can <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to look at <unk> as limitation or woe that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
There are three superpowers who are <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests on cartography, visualization data, travel, mathematics and design, I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
Hence the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> we become <unk> we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and <unk>
As a girl who had an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when he was starting their practices and this ability to write compelling launches for the editors.
It's rarely a loss of time to get to what you would tell you to even if at the end of the end of it.
It is possible to apply that knowledge on a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower <unk> is adaptability. It's to say, the ability to transform anything that you need in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, a few pages designer designer designer -- sometimes a teacher, and sometimes apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take a variety of roles -- depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Magazine Company defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> out of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a huge interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
<unk> from the belly knowing that they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive in deep and put ideas, and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all be designing lives and careers that are linked to how we're connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in large part they were told to simply be more like their fellow <unk>
Once we said this, if there's one thing that you take out of this talk, I hope that's this: <unk> with the inner wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then you would take all the media.
That's where you get the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just came to realize will be one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I tell them, <unk> their lots of passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> he took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately, passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a autopsy. And they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who'd never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you would have been alive today, we could not give her more help than the fact that he <unk> gave him a few years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the infections, many treatments for cancer for HIV, <unk> for HIV, for much more.
But it has been done in Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it's going to affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability of the age of going to spend their years of Alzheimer's disease or helping care to a friend or dear Alzheimer's disease.
In America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
So today is the most expensive disease and its costs -- an increase in five times in the year by 2050, as the generation of <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little done to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 percent causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the age of it.
U.S. government spends 10 times every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's percent of the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and causes a annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, years, all of us, scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal part and inevitable of aging.
But there's only looking at a picture of a healthy aged healthy compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to having severe memory loss and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about it.
We now know that they're made of proteins.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper it folds up like origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these dots <unk> end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> points are left outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step blocked is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb down.
You have to find the right step that is blocked and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in its most part, the wires have been reduced and waiting for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemistry, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's take a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick into each other, like we have Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial positive outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that it grows that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to convince ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have sparked more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to advance the HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk to themselves.
And their families, the Mayan victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most of a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
We took this article in the spinal York column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The paper about a psychological study is designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and from my own experience when we test it in the past summer, it was last night.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 more and smaller questions and then both look in the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you go to another person?
And <unk>
We get <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to do with him or she -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really detail really struck me the attention, the gadget that two participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, I was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the occasion of trying to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
But I thought it was <unk> and   And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the spine that I will think about a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already August, so I guess some of you probably are asking yourself, they are still <unk>
And the reason I think it's <unk> this is because they've asked me this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
One week before the paper was published was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I'd been pleased to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entry can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand views.
And that has a good attention burden on a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night, and on Saturday, this happened in the traffic traffic.
And the Sunday, I already had called the Today the Show and the Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the article got over eight million views, and I was, to say something, <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing about personal experiences -- but another thing is to discover that life loving one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or he wrote it, what they did every day for weeks, they would first do the same question: are still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And various messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and <unk> and <unk> like this.
I was interviewed by radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put it red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship on a international cell, you should expect people to feel comfortable wondering about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> of their life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for Saint <unk> who included the experiences of readers to prove the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that both of us would make a public emergence together.
I had television interviews, and he refused to adopt the photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked work, they wanted to know if it was really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love, not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you put it together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 times less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the purpose of the researcher was not to make romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking at what was looking for interpersonal approach, between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It sounds romantic, right?
But the study worked.
Participants felt closer after doing it. Several later studies, they were also using protocol, <unk> protocol as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used between the members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people of opposite policy.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little <unk> university university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed like it was <unk>
And I said, "You want to say you <unk> the person with whom you <unk>
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
Yet I don't think that that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what was supposed to almost all of my adult life, and he was my first true love, and he had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I went back to science.
I did all that I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just worked for the book that I was writing about, but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I used to feel like that.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one other way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand for what I'm after.
But I can also see myself more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably well can demand me.
What I'm looking for of love is a <unk> not just to be loved today and being loved morning, but I'm going to continue to be proud indefinitely for the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know if we were to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to make some way to mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very scary story because they love us feeling beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
So the story of the story that says, still follow together?
And his content with an answer of <unk> or No.
So more than a question, I would propose that we do more difficult questions, questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things come together, and how to know when to cut and to <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year, and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love -- not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> Love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love because we took the choice to be.
And I shudder to read it a little bit about it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that choice was.
It didn't think how long we would have both to make that decision, and how much times I'm going to have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose me.
I want it to be enough to have done and said, 36 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous, kind and fun, and we have expressed that choice in the largest American diary.
But what I've done, instead is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what you want, and what I'm going to spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually written.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by both lesbian at full mountain, and in a way, I came as a <unk> of the forest.
New York City a time.  Something that really affected me but more detail later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and he <unk> a dollar, a dollar, a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has a little bit of grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
And in a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took out all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> style -- Agnes Martin -- he sat there and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's got to be <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: in some ways it seemed to rise as much size, as if it was that we would get the text with a <unk>
So I did I did that I built more boxes.
And this time, I started adding the electronic elements, which we were finding on the street, everything I could find on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow you <unk> like you do about a dead body in the crime scene.
And I took out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started to build exhibits and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, <unk> sculptures of human size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk> me.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to drawing in a window and then another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that created a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work worked with something very big, that I call <unk>
By the <unk> I was inspired by as much in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double faces, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> mesh <unk> where they <unk>
Here is where creatures with heads of animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide lists in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird God tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform of the <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> -- there's all sorts of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which you <unk>
And then when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a 5.5 <unk> a foot of snake that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turned fire into a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why that happened.
Things that go up, you know.
Their tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made out of 1986.
They've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
It's very <unk>   This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each acts as a kind of file in form of being human, and they travel in 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, and they will be <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 billion pounds with a flying human inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> the <unk> can be <unk>
I'm going to be able to see you all over the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher from these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a running body in half.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There's a few pills that come out and come into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a museum, a <unk> an op-ed -- a publishing arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world; and a garden.
They put up the box and all of the people in it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, from the borders, the religion, it doesn't work.
We're all really made of the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your mind?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug is given to the body.
The <unk> however, is that by <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they serve it to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the skin <unk>
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in their most negative, because in the time you take it to the current stream -- your blood is <unk> and worse even over the time that you take it to its destiny, which is where it's most important, in the HIV shock.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> the <unk> the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are being bent to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a life treatment run by being oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use them in <unk> for wounds and wounds and diabetes, they can be used for anything else -- including transportation drug transportation.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open up or drill and drill extremely small holes, which opens up and close to the cells that are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are like, "What is that <unk>
We sent a little laser beam laser over the cell membrane living by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in terms of <unk>
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology now in vitro plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> Can you ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it goes to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher in the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed armed groups like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
Tell me what these groups do when they're not shoot off.
My goal is to understand better to these nuclear agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation into violent confrontation, not violent.
I do work in the field, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solving the whole conflict of course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors and non-governmental actors.
For example, of the <unk> deals of peace deals in 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they make it, how do they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political struggle was <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> armed groups are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s -- <unk> also has established a political party -- a network of social services and a military services.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Bank of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups are making more than just to fire.
They're multitasking to you.
We had a complex communication engine, stations. radio radio stations radio channels, online websites and strategies in social networks.
And here's the <unk> <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
Dark groups are also going to invest in a complex tax <unk> but using <unk> business for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
Local groups do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools -- they run schools and run professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Local groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that has no security and protection.
The ascent of Taliban in an Afghanistan <unk> in the war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be understood by <unk> the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher price per population for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election <unk> of 2006 in Palestinian <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work.
It's a really complex scenario even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up gaps <unk> by government, and emerge as armed and political groups, engage in nonviolent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated are these organizations, less we can do it as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run all of its <unk> collect the trash, and they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of state, without a state and hybrids and the more they are the states, like in the Middle East today, more scales and fill that gap the actors are not government.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in a military tools.
We have that vacuum of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we better understand groups that we will better understand what incentives we offer to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors, military power can win some battle, but not to give peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum of security, to fill that vacuum of security that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the tag of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but quite bad.
And therefore I became a bad feminist feminist.
Or at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The evil <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and hate sex. As if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women treated the women around the world and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people to <unk> that could be a feminist.
Being labeled as feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty.
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is trying to get too much in self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman, and he can't imagine being another person.
And over time, as I grew up, I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, I actually feminist, and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They took the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as the free <unk> or violence.
We have right to use it to be easy and accessible to contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines of <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in mind our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social, skills and much more.
We have to have in account these differences and how we behave in the same way that it matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I've got another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music -- all volume.
Although the letter <unk> to women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin -- yang yang is incredible.
<unk> actually with your <unk> t-shirt
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
Let's have poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical thinking.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  all I don't want to do --   -- all the things that I don't want to do, but they will also kill insects, the <unk> <unk> and the <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
<unk> of the fashion magazines and things right.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not a <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to the same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they were born.
It would take this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, and gay workers and <unk> for white, white, <unk> in middle-class and high.
<unk> if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist man.
It also happens to the next thing, as I <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we will be <unk>
When we get to <unk> them with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to be <unk> before I try to wear there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders in sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> fear of what that tag means that this tag is so afraid to be able to be able to fulfill the <unk>
Let's take a <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music 2014, in <unk> instead of the word <unk> of 3,000 feet tall.
It was a <unk> show to look at this star of <unk> embrace openly feminism and make women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical cultural critics started endless arguments if <unk> was or not just a feminist.
It took your feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go much beyond the sensible and constructive and constructive criticism to give us feminism from any woman, <unk> until it's nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, feminism feminism is the point of departure.
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our imperfections to the day, to go to action and be a little bit more brave.
If I hear music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> <unk>
These artists are not going to change their way of talking about women in their songs until we interpret change affecting change their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
And they were given to the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice is going to behave like something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television show is about sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio input when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not dealing with women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers, as <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, to participate in his project, or work with you, until I don't include a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
These are the ones that are <unk> but we can be able to participate in this type of projects, we can also engage it to be even more like us to be able to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
And we are because we're not a <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in the power managers and producers of film and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and lasting change in the way.
We can also tell the courage to us, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, above all, because ancient my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few guys were <unk> when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I took my voice, and after all of it I didn't get to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I got myself in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have your brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and of feminism, I also found that if I was a little courageous woman, another woman could tell and see me and see that none of us is the thing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the goofy reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad revolution, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need a <unk>
Right after last year, <unk> children in California had measles for having visited <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things from this outbreak is that measles can be terrible for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily treatable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something was supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed argument about autism and vaccines <unk> <unk> and marked by being an fraud <unk> by British Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that the theory cause autism causes autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world continue to make a difference that vaccines are put in danger to their children from having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise estimates of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> who had heard about her create a whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, estimates of prevalence continued to stable just three or four children per 10,000 children.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> funds like <unk> <unk> they routinely refer to autism as an HIV epidemic, as if I could catch another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Centers for Disease Control and what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnostic and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of her son of two years, the visual contact face.
If the criteria of diagnosis, they had to figure out why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened to have less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the seductive power of storytelling.
Over the most part of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital. In <unk> <unk> he published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed <unk> private worlds <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun during hours by waving your hands in front of their faces, but they were <unk> of panic to <unk> like when he didn't put their favorite toy into their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients who were treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria criteria for behavioral diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but we now know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
He was once <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 children sent by other doctors sent by being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a clever man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have kept very carefully on a fridge that they don't know.
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 to the age before they turned two to the two.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were simply paying for, what they had heard of their parents who were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became the source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, turning into invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, thought that the theory of the mothers of <unk> mothers was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and warm people and had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed Susie, without special education, no access to other resources without diagnosis.
In order to defend the National <unk> Service, they needed more resources for the autistic children and their families, <unk> and his colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
It was a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse was alive.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of <unk>
In another way, these children didn't fit very early <unk> and <unk> as they said, and you saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody realize these kids before?
But then I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was talking German, and he was translated for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic, with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with differences of learning were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music, and the kids kept their games on them for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, <unk> described as a <unk> disability of life that required shapes to support and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he went to help in the development of the education methods that were particularly suited to them.
<unk> had seen autism as a diverse continuum that <unk> an amazing variety of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> in <unk> culture as the social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even saying that to success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic Association that we were called the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and the early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by one wide and <unk>
These changes didn't go on a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between all the way to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult adult life.
Before I was coming out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what was autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, it's introduced to the first easy health tests to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it was, and what people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the rise in the <unk> and a simple, powerful history and seductive history that autism is that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic ones are one of the world's largest groups.
Over the last few years, people have put together on the Internet to reject the idea that they are puzzles for solving the new breakthroughs for the new breakthroughs and <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of social operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean that it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
Certainly autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding the understanding of teachers, employers with ability, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands in deck for <unk> the <unk>
As we move into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
